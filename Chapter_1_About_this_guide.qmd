# About this guide
## Who is this guide for?

This guide is concerned with the analysis of climatic data. It is for
four types of reader: The first is those concerned with the collection
and subsequent use of their climatic data. This includes staff of
national meteorological services, (NMSs) who are often the custodians of
the historical climatic data for their country. There are many others
who collect climatic data, for example schools and colleges, farms,
agricultural institutes and many individuals.

Second is the users who need results from an analysis of historical
climatic data. They may undertake analyses themselves, or, at least,
need to know what is possible from the data. They are in many walks of
life, including agriculture, health, flood prevention, water supply,
renewable energy, building, tourism and insurance.

The other two groups are concerned more with teaching and learning
statistics. Looking at climatic data is an application of interest to
many people; partly because of the effects that climate has on many
areas. Also because of the many issues of climate change.

So, the third group is those who teach statistics. This guide shows how
simple statistical ideas are used in solving practical problems in one
application area. The key concepts of sensible data handling are the
same whatever the area of application.

The final group consists of those who have to learn statistics. Many
people recognize that they need statistics skills for their work but
sometimes find their statistics courses are difficult to relate to
real-life applications. The materials here are complementary, by
starting with the application and considering the statistical ideas that
are needed to process the data.

These groups overlap. For example, many users of climatic data are also
conscious of their need for further training in statistics.

## Why is it needed?

Many organizations have devoted more effort to collecting climatic data
than to their subsequent analysis. This is like other areas where
monitoring data are collected routinely. One way that climatic data is
perhaps different is that much of the data has an important immediate
use. It is an input for the short-term forecasts and for other immediate
monitoring of the current season. This might be termed a "spatial need"
in that these applications benefit from lots of data from different
places at the same time. These data are then stored, and this guide is
for a "time series need". Most of the analyses in this guide are for
long records in time. They may be for one, or more, points in space.

Sometimes the excuse for the lack of analysis is that the quality of the
data is suspect. This is not a good reason, because one way to improve
data quality is to analyze the existing data to demonstrate their
importance and shortcomings.

It is also useful if those who collect data can do their own analysis,
or at least be involved in the analysis. This is highly motivating for
staff and an excellent way to encourage good data quality.

Some familiarity with the use of software (under Windows) is assumed.
Knowledge of statistics is useful, but not essential for most chapters.
Indeed, though this guide cannot substitute for a conventional
statistics book, users can learn many general ideas through seeing where
different techniques are useful.

## What software is used?

This guide uses the R Statistical system (R Core Team, 2018). It mainly
uses R through a graphical user interface, called R-Instat. An earlier
version of this guide (Stern, Rijks, Dale, & Knock, 2006) was for a
simple statistics package, called Instat. Like the original Instat,
R-Instat combines a general statistics package with a special additional
menu to simplify the analysis of climatic data.

R-Instat is designed to support improved learning of statistics in
general as well as providing a wide range of special dialogues to
simplify, and hence facilitate, the analysis of climatic data.

## What is in this guide?

Illustrations and 'route maps' are provided in all chapters for those
who just wish to study particular topics. We hope that some users will
enjoy the way the ideas unfold in successive chapters but do not assume
that readers will wish to look at every chapter. Most chapters are in a
"tutorial" style, so readers can follow, and practice at the same time.
There is considerable repetition, to support users to "dip into" the
chapters they need.

How much practice is needed, depends on the user's current experience in
statistical computing. Those who are relatively inexperienced, or have
never used a statistics package, may be surprised at how easy the ideas
and the software are. However, beginners need practice, so just reading
the guide will not be so effective.

Those with experience of a statistics package should find that R-Instat
is like many other statistics packages. Then practice is not so
important, because they should be able to visualize the results from
just reading the text.

We assume R-Instat has already been installed, see
[[http://r-instat.org/index.html]{.underline}](http://r-instat.org/index.html).

Chapters 2 and 3 provide practice of using R-Instat in general. Climatic
data are used, but not the special climatic menu. They assume initial
knowledge of R-Instat that could be from the two initial tutorials.
Beginners should go through these tutorials, while others may just need
to see the corresponding videos.

Chapters 4 to 7 show the use of the R-Instat climatic menu. The
structure of the climatic menu mirrors the main menus. It has items in
the order that is usually needed in an analysis. First is ***File***, to
input the data, then ***Prepare***, to organise them for analysis, then
***Describe***, to analyse the data without assuming a particular
(statistical) model. Lastly, the menu includes some special modelling
items.

If your need is to analyze your own climatic data as quickly as
possible, then you may choose to omit Chapters 2 and 3 initially.
Chapter 4 describes the R-Instat "climatic system". This is then assumed
in later chapters. Chapter 5 is on initial exploration of the data and
on quality control. Chapter 6 produces and analyses "standard"
summaries, such as rainfall totals, while Chapter 7 examines "tailored
products" such as the start of the rains.

Chapter 8 examines further features of R-Instat, particularly for users
of climatic data who may wish to migrate from R-Instat to using R
itself. There are inevitable limits to the efficient processing of data
with a menu-driven package. This idea is already introduced in Chapter 3
where Section 3.5 is titled "Don't let the computer laugh at you".
Hence, for example, Chapter 8 considers how particular climatic analyses
can be done, using tools in R that are currently absent from R-Instat.

The remaining chapters examine more specialised topics. Chapter 9 is on
the input and analysis of gridded satellite and reanalysis data. Chapter
10 is on mapping and 11 introduces the important area of extremes.

The PICSA (Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture)
project is described briefly in Section 1.6 and in more detail in
Chapter 12.

The remaining chapters are on a range of further topics including the
(statistical approach to) the seasonal forecast, the use of stochastic
models, the processing of within-day data (e.g. from automatic stations)
and the analysis of circular data, particularly for wind direction.

All the data sets used for illustration are supplied in the R-Instat
"library". Chapter 3 describes how the data are organized, so readers
can substitute their own data for the examples in later chapters.

The analysis of the climatic records is often a two-stage process. The
first stage reduces the raw, often daily, data to a semi-processed form
with key summaries that correspond to users\' needs. The second stage
involves processing these summaries.

This two-stage process is typical of the processing of many types of
data and is one reason why users often find their statistics training
did not seem relevant to real-world problems. Many courses use only
small sets of semi-processed data that are tailored to the topic being
taught. However, the real world starts with primary data, and these are
often quite large.

## Climatology, statistics, and computing?

Readers who are not confident in statistics should recognize the three
different subjects that are in this guide, namely climatology,
statistics, and computing. The material becomes easier if you separate
these subjects as far as possible.

R is a programming language and those who are already adept in R may
find they do not need the R-Instat menus and dialogues but can use
RStudio more efficiently for the same analyses. In contrast, beginners
in R, sometimes find it difficult to use in their statistics courses.
They are still trying to master the computing ideas, and this becomes
mixed with the statistical objectives.

Computing ideas are raised at various points in this guide, because
users sometimes limit the analyses they conduct, by not exploiting the
software fully. So, we show how R-Instat can be used in different ways,
to solve problems raised by users in their needs for data analysis.
These sections should be recognized as largely computing topics and
perhaps omitted initially by those who have less interest in using R
itself.

Statistics and climatology have two features in common. Both are
relevant to a wide range of applications and many specialists in those
application areas treat both statisticians and climatologists as an
unwelcome nuisance! Perhaps by working together, they can be welcomed
more.

## Climate Services for Agriculture

Many countries have projects on climate and agriculture. These projects
often concentrate on sharing the information on the short-term and
seasonal forecasts with producers. We outline one such project, called
PICSA (Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture). More
information on PICSA is here:
[[https://research.reading.ac.uk/picsa/]{.underline}](https://research.reading.ac.uk/picsa/).

The different component of PICSA are shown in Fig. 1.6a

A distinguishing feature of PICSA is the first panel in Fig. 1.6 and
this is in addition to the forecasting activities. The first panel is on
aspects that are based on an analysis of the historical climatic
records, that are shared with small-scale farmers, before the seasonal
forecast is available. The National Met Service (NMS) is a key partner
in each country and provides analyses of the historical data. These
analyses use the methods described in Chapters 6 and 7 of this guide and
are from the climatic stations that are as close as possible to
different groups of farmers. PICSA is described in Chapter 12.

## The Climsoft Climate Data Management System

Climsoft is a free and open source system for the entry and management
of primary climatic data. The initial screen is shown in Fig. 1.7a. It
has facilities for the entry and checking of data from paper records,
and for the transfer of data from previous systems, and from automatic
stations. The data, and metadata are currently held in a mysql database.

Climsoft is designed particularly for National Met Services (NMSs), but
can be used by any other organisation that has to manage historical
climatic or other related data. A wide range of elements are
pre-defined, but others can be added for hydrology, pollution or other
aspects. Data can be at any scale, e.g. daily, 10-minute.

Climsoft includes some products, but not many. Instead, R-Instat can
read data directly from Climsoft, or exported from Climsoft, and is
designed as the products' partner to Climsoft. In later versions of
Climsoft the plan is for some of the R-routines in R-Instat to become
part of Climsoft.
