{"title":"About this guide","markdown":{"headingText":"About this guide","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"## Who is this guide for?\n\nThis guide is concerned with the analysis of climatic data. It is for\nfour types of reader: The first is those concerned with the collection\nand subsequent use of their climatic data. This includes staff of\nnational meteorological services, (NMSs) who are often the custodians of\nthe historical climatic data for their country. There are many others\nwho collect climatic data, for example schools and colleges, farms,\nagricultural institutes and many individuals.\n\nSecond is the users who need results from an analysis of historical\nclimatic data. They may undertake analyses themselves, or, at least,\nneed to know what is possible from the data. They are in many walks of\nlife, including agriculture, health, flood prevention, water supply,\nrenewable energy, building, tourism and insurance.\n\nThe other two groups are concerned more with teaching and learning\nstatistics. Looking at climatic data is an application of interest to\nmany people; partly because of the effects that climate has on many\nareas. Also because of the many issues of climate change.\n\nSo, the third group is those who teach statistics. This guide shows how\nsimple statistical ideas are used in solving practical problems in one\napplication area. The key concepts of sensible data handling are the\nsame whatever the area of application.\n\nThe final group consists of those who have to learn statistics. Many\npeople recognize that they need statistics skills for their work but\nsometimes find their statistics courses are difficult to relate to\nreal-life applications. The materials here are complementary, by\nstarting with the application and considering the statistical ideas that\nare needed to process the data.\n\nThese groups overlap. For example, many users of climatic data are also\nconscious of their need for further training in statistics.\n\n## Why is it needed?\n\nMany organizations have devoted more effort to collecting climatic data\nthan to their subsequent analysis. This is like other areas where\nmonitoring data are collected routinely. One way that climatic data is\nperhaps different is that much of the data has an important immediate\nuse. It is an input for the short-term forecasts and for other immediate\nmonitoring of the current season. This might be termed a \"spatial need\"\nin that these applications benefit from lots of data from different\nplaces at the same time. These data are then stored, and this guide is\nfor a \"time series need\". Most of the analyses in this guide are for\nlong records in time. They may be for one, or more, points in space.\n\nSometimes the excuse for the lack of analysis is that the quality of the\ndata is suspect. This is not a good reason, because one way to improve\ndata quality is to analyze the existing data to demonstrate their\nimportance and shortcomings.\n\nIt is also useful if those who collect data can do their own analysis,\nor at least be involved in the analysis. This is highly motivating for\nstaff and an excellent way to encourage good data quality.\n\nSome familiarity with the use of software (under Windows) is assumed.\nKnowledge of statistics is useful, but not essential for most chapters.\nIndeed, though this guide cannot substitute for a conventional\nstatistics book, users can learn many general ideas through seeing where\ndifferent techniques are useful.\n\n## What software is used?\n\nThis guide uses the R Statistical system (R Core Team, 2018). It mainly\nuses R through a graphical user interface, called R-Instat. An earlier\nversion of this guide (Stern, Rijks, Dale, & Knock, 2006) was for a\nsimple statistics package, called Instat. Like the original Instat,\nR-Instat combines a general statistics package with a special additional\nmenu to simplify the analysis of climatic data.\n\nR-Instat is designed to support improved learning of statistics in\ngeneral as well as providing a wide range of special dialogues to\nsimplify, and hence facilitate, the analysis of climatic data.\n\n## What is in this guide?\n\nIllustrations and 'route maps' are provided in all chapters for those\nwho just wish to study particular topics. We hope that some users will\nenjoy the way the ideas unfold in successive chapters but do not assume\nthat readers will wish to look at every chapter. Most chapters are in a\n\"tutorial\" style, so readers can follow, and practice at the same time.\nThere is considerable repetition, to support users to \"dip into\" the\nchapters they need.\n\nHow much practice is needed, depends on the user's current experience in\nstatistical computing. Those who are relatively inexperienced, or have\nnever used a statistics package, may be surprised at how easy the ideas\nand the software are. However, beginners need practice, so just reading\nthe guide will not be so effective.\n\nThose with experience of a statistics package should find that R-Instat\nis like many other statistics packages. Then practice is not so\nimportant, because they should be able to visualize the results from\njust reading the text.\n\nWe assume R-Instat has already been installed, see\n[[http://r-instat.org/index.html]{.underline}](http://r-instat.org/index.html).\n\nChapters 2 and 3 provide practice of using R-Instat in general. Climatic\ndata are used, but not the special climatic menu. They assume initial\nknowledge of R-Instat that could be from the two initial tutorials.\nBeginners should go through these tutorials, while others may just need\nto see the corresponding videos.\n\nChapters 4 to 7 show the use of the R-Instat climatic menu. The\nstructure of the climatic menu mirrors the main menus. It has items in\nthe order that is usually needed in an analysis. First is ***File***, to\ninput the data, then ***Prepare***, to organise them for analysis, then\n***Describe***, to analyse the data without assuming a particular\n(statistical) model. Lastly, the menu includes some special modelling\nitems.\n\nIf your need is to analyze your own climatic data as quickly as\npossible, then you may choose to omit Chapters 2 and 3 initially.\nChapter 4 describes the R-Instat \"climatic system\". This is then assumed\nin later chapters. Chapter 5 is on initial exploration of the data and\non quality control. Chapter 6 produces and analyses \"standard\"\nsummaries, such as rainfall totals, while Chapter 7 examines \"tailored\nproducts\" such as the start of the rains.\n\nChapter 8 examines further features of R-Instat, particularly for users\nof climatic data who may wish to migrate from R-Instat to using R\nitself. There are inevitable limits to the efficient processing of data\nwith a menu-driven package. This idea is already introduced in Chapter 3\nwhere Section 3.5 is titled \"Don't let the computer laugh at you\".\nHence, for example, Chapter 8 considers how particular climatic analyses\ncan be done, using tools in R that are currently absent from R-Instat.\n\nThe remaining chapters examine more specialised topics. Chapter 9 is on\nthe input and analysis of gridded satellite and reanalysis data. Chapter\n10 is on mapping and 11 introduces the important area of extremes.\n\nThe PICSA (Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture)\nproject is described briefly in Section 1.6 and in more detail in\nChapter 12.\n\nThe remaining chapters are on a range of further topics including the\n(statistical approach to) the seasonal forecast, the use of stochastic\nmodels, the processing of within-day data (e.g. from automatic stations)\nand the analysis of circular data, particularly for wind direction.\n\nAll the data sets used for illustration are supplied in the R-Instat\n\"library\". Chapter 3 describes how the data are organized, so readers\ncan substitute their own data for the examples in later chapters.\n\nThe analysis of the climatic records is often a two-stage process. The\nfirst stage reduces the raw, often daily, data to a semi-processed form\nwith key summaries that correspond to users\\' needs. The second stage\ninvolves processing these summaries.\n\nThis two-stage process is typical of the processing of many types of\ndata and is one reason why users often find their statistics training\ndid not seem relevant to real-world problems. Many courses use only\nsmall sets of semi-processed data that are tailored to the topic being\ntaught. However, the real world starts with primary data, and these are\noften quite large.\n\n## Climatology, statistics, and computing?\n\nReaders who are not confident in statistics should recognize the three\ndifferent subjects that are in this guide, namely climatology,\nstatistics, and computing. The material becomes easier if you separate\nthese subjects as far as possible.\n\nR is a programming language and those who are already adept in R may\nfind they do not need the R-Instat menus and dialogues but can use\nRStudio more efficiently for the same analyses. In contrast, beginners\nin R, sometimes find it difficult to use in their statistics courses.\nThey are still trying to master the computing ideas, and this becomes\nmixed with the statistical objectives.\n\nComputing ideas are raised at various points in this guide, because\nusers sometimes limit the analyses they conduct, by not exploiting the\nsoftware fully. So, we show how R-Instat can be used in different ways,\nto solve problems raised by users in their needs for data analysis.\nThese sections should be recognized as largely computing topics and\nperhaps omitted initially by those who have less interest in using R\nitself.\n\nStatistics and climatology have two features in common. Both are\nrelevant to a wide range of applications and many specialists in those\napplication areas treat both statisticians and climatologists as an\nunwelcome nuisance! Perhaps by working together, they can be welcomed\nmore.\n\n## Climate Services for Agriculture\n\nMany countries have projects on climate and agriculture. These projects\noften concentrate on sharing the information on the short-term and\nseasonal forecasts with producers. We outline one such project, called\nPICSA (Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture). More\ninformation on PICSA is here:\n[[https://research.reading.ac.uk/picsa/]{.underline}](https://research.reading.ac.uk/picsa/).\n\nThe different component of PICSA are shown in Fig. 1.6a\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 1.6a The PICSA project***\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](media/image1407.png){width=\"5.643466754155731in\"\n  height=\"4.150380577427821in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA distinguishing feature of PICSA is the first panel in Fig. 1.6 and\nthis is in addition to the forecasting activities. The first panel is on\naspects that are based on an analysis of the historical climatic\nrecords, that are shared with small-scale farmers, before the seasonal\nforecast is available. The National Met Service (NMS) is a key partner\nin each country and provides analyses of the historical data. These\nanalyses use the methods described in Chapters 6 and 7 of this guide and\nare from the climatic stations that are as close as possible to\ndifferent groups of farmers. PICSA is described in Chapter 12.\n\n## The Climsoft Climate Data Management System\n\nClimsoft is a free and open source system for the entry and management\nof primary climatic data. The initial screen is shown in Fig. 1.7a. It\nhas facilities for the entry and checking of data from paper records,\nand for the transfer of data from previous systems, and from automatic\nstations. The data, and metadata are currently held in a mysql database.\n\nClimsoft is designed particularly for National Met Services (NMSs), but\ncan be used by any other organisation that has to manage historical\nclimatic or other related data. A wide range of elements are\npre-defined, but others can be added for hydrology, pollution or other\naspects. Data can be at any scale, e.g. daily, 10-minute.\n\nClimsoft includes some products, but not many. Instead, R-Instat can\nread data directly from Climsoft, or exported from Climsoft, and is\ndesigned as the products' partner to Climsoft. In later versions of\nClimsoft the plan is for some of the R-routines in R-Instat to become\npart of Climsoft.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig.
