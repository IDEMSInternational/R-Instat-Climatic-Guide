The smallest value usually recorded is 0.1mm, but we find\n    stations are not equally conscientious in recording very small\n    amounts. So, if 0.1mm is used, then it is harder to compare the\n    pattern of rainfall at different stations. Records also differ in\n    their attitudes on rounding. So, some records have far fewer values\n    of 0.9 or 1.1mm than others. There is also an old issue that some\n    stations used to measure in inches and the smallest value was then\n    0.01 inches. This translates to 0.3mm and higher values are 0.5, 0.8\n    and 1mm. So 0.9mm is not possible in data that used to be in inches.\n    Hence the threshold of 0.85mm is a practical way of implementing\n    \"1mm and above\".\n\n[^2]: The body of the boxplot is not blue by default. For this, choose\n    ***Boxplot Options*** in Fig. 2.2e, then choose the ***Geom\n    Parameters*** tab and change the ***Fill colour*** to your choice.\n\n[^3]: This is partly because the \"Omit Missing Values\" checkbox in Fig.\n    2.3c was left unchecked. Coping with missing values in the data,\n    when summaries are calculated, is a complex issue. It is discussed\n    in detail in Chapter 6.\n\n[^4]: The graph in Fig. 2.4k also starts from 0. This used the Yaxis tab\n    in Fig. 2.3j.\n\n[^5]: R is case sensitive. So Date and date are different variable\n    names. Hence make sure you use Date as the new name.\n\n[^6]: If the names of your date columns are not the same, then use the\n    Options sub-dialogue to tell R-Instat which columns to match.\n\n[^7]: The missing values are because a full join was used in the merging\n    process. The satellite data are up to 2015, while the observed data\n    are to 2013. One way of avoiding the problem is to use a Left Join\n    instead.\n\n[^8]: Use Tools \\> Options \\> Data View to change these values. However,\n    this may have a speed effect on R-Instat.\n\n[^9]: This is the Dodoma data used in Chapter 2. Use ***File \\> Open\n    from Library \\> Instat \\> Climatic \\> Original Climate Guide Data***\n    and choose ***Dodoma*** to open these data.\n\n[^10]: An R data book is special to R-Instat. Hence these RDS files\n    cannot be opened directly in R, for example in RStudio. We describe,\n    in Section 3.3 how you can transfer your R-Instat work to RStudio.\n\n[^11]: Changing the number of significant figures does not change any of\n    the data in R at all. It just changes how it is presented in the\n    grid. If you do want to change the number, then use the R-Instat\n    Calculator with Prepare \\> Column: Calculate \\> Calculations, where\n    the maths keyboard has round and various other functions that can be\n    applied.\n\n[^12]: This can be changed if not appropriate.\n\n[^13]: Sometimes the graph in the R viewer does not seem to appear, or\n    it appears and then disappears again. This is because it is on a\n    totally separate window. In this case look in the R-Instat icon in\n    the taskbar at the bottom of the screen.\n\n[^14]: The extra feature in Fig. 3.4 is the date of each outlier, which\n    helps in the quality control. This is provided by the label argument\n    in the ***Describe \\> Specific \\> Scatter Plot*** dialogue in Fig.\n    3.4h.\n\n[^15]: Though a \"list\" is something different in R.\n\n[^16]: We could alternatively have used Climatic \\> Tidy and Examine \\>\n    Replace Values in R-Instat and then changed the columns to be\n    numeric. But it is simpler to do a Find and Replace in Excel.\n\n[^17]: Use Climatic \\> Tidy and Examine \\> Replace Values.\n\n[^18]: This issue was with Climsoft Version 3.2. The problem has been\n    resolved in later versions.\n\n[^19]: They use ***Describe \\> Specific \\> Line Plot*** dialogue, with\n    the ***Date*** column as the x-variable.\n\n[^20]: To filter, one way is to return to the data, and right-click to\n    set up the filter. Alternatively press the Data Options button in\n    any dialogue, here Fig. 5.2h. Then filter to select just the first\n    station.\n\n[^21]: The Climatic \\> dates \\> Use Date dialogue is used to generate\n    the quarters.\n\n[^22]: In Section 3.3 we show how a skew boxplot may be constructed as a\n    preferred graph for rainfall data.\n\n[^23]: From the main ***Climatic \\> Check Data \\> Boxplot*** dialogue,\n    with ***Tmin*** as the variable, use ***Plot Options \\> Layer \\>\n    Add*** to give Fig. 5.3j. Include ***Tmax*** as the y, Fig. 5.3j,\n    then use the ***Layer Parameters*** tab, Fig. 5.3j, and set the\n    ***Outlier colour*** to ***red***. Then ***Return*** to the main\n    dialogue and ***Ok***.\n\n[^24]: This feature is common and is largely due to the possibility of\n    lower values of Tmax on some rainy days. One way to check this\n    feature is the filter the data and just consider the Tmax data on\n    dry days.\n\n[^25]: An outlier is when a point is further from the respective\n    quartile than 1.5 times the interquartile range.\n\n[^26]: This threshold is like the value of 1mm sometimes suggested by\n    WMO. The smallest value usually recorded is 0.1mm, but we find that\n    stations are not equally conscientious in recording very small\n    amounts. So, if 0.1mm is used, then it is harder to compare the\n    pattern of rainfall at different stations. Records also differ in\n    their attitudes on rounding. So some records have far fewer values\n    of 0.9 or 1.1mm than others. There is also an old issue that some\n    stations used to measure in inches and the smallest value was then\n    0.01 inches. This translates to 0.3mm and higher values are 0.5, 0.8\n    and 1mm. So, 0.9mm is not possible in data that used to be in\n    inches. Hence the threshold of 0.85mm is a practical way of\n    implementing \"1mm and above\".\n\n[^27]: And, of course, if it is not possible with the ordinary R-Instat\n    menus it may still be possible using R directly.\n\n[^28]: To find the equation and level of significance of this result you\n    could then use the ***Model \\> Two Variable*** dialogue\n\n[^29]: To add the colour, we also used the ***Boxplot Options*** in Fig.\n    6.4d and specified the ***Fill Colour*** as green.\n\n[^30]: We also used the Data Options and filtered on the Months to use\n    just March to October.\n\n[^31]: It uses the 2 factors month and station for the facets.\n\n[^32]: ***Filter to 1962 at Saltpond*** and use ***Climatic \\> Check\n    Data \\> Display Daily***.\n\n[^33]: In the current version of R-Instat the Plot Options are disabled\n    for multiple variables. Hence set the facets before setting the\n    variables to Multiple. Set them back to Single Variable if you wish\n    to edit the Plot Options. This limitation will be removed in a\n    future version.\n\n[^34]: Monthly means are calculated using ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\>\n    Climatic Summaries*** as shown in Fig. 6.6k. The data are then\n    filtered to just 1971 to 1980 for Saltpond. Then the results could\n    be shown in the output window, but we chose to unstack the data, by\n    Month to give the display shown in Fig. 6.6h.\n\n[^35]: Use ***Prepare \\> Column: Calculate \\> Calculation*** with the\n    formula ***round(max_temperature\\*9/5+32)***.\n\n[^36]: An alternative to renaming the variables is to change the names\n    of the new variables in the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Start of the\n    Rains*** dialogue, Fig. 7.3a.\n\n[^37]: The file called Moorings 7.4.rds from ***File \\> Open from\n    Library,*** contains the data including the variables from Section\n    7.3.\n\n[^38]: To plot as shown in Fig. 7.6h, use ***Climatic \\> Tidy and\n    Examine \\> Stack*** with the 3 totals, carrying the ***s_year***\n    variable. Then, on the ***Climatic \\> PICSA \\> Rainfall Graph***,\n    choose Plot Options and Facets and make the layout vertical.\n\n[^39]: Include the checkbox to display the zero values as \"---\".\n\n[^40]: Plotting exceedance graphs is one way to examine these data. Our\n    use\n\n[^41]: The default gives the x-axis as numeric. The presentation shown,\n    as dates within the year, will soon be easy, but currently it needs\n    a little coding as described in Chapter 8.\n\n[^42]: They are higher because they include years where a dry spell may\n    have started before the given dates and continued into the flowering\n    period. The earlier calculation (following planting) assumed the\n    previous day had rain -- as it was a potential planting date.)\n\n[^43]: If we move the dekad column \"down one row\", , that's the\n    ***lead*** function (lag is the opposite) then these are the rows\n    when the two columns are different, (i.e. !=). So, with the\n    ***dekad_abbr*** variable the function: ***dekad_abbr !=\n    lead(dekad_abbr)*** is used. We need to specify the R package for\n    the ***lead*** function, so give the command as ***dekad_abbr !=\n    dplyr::lead(dekad_abbr)***\n\n[^44]: In Fig. 7.8ad we have also filtered to omit the very dry months\n    of the year.\n\n[^45]: This adds two ***layers*** to the boxplot with the data from the\n    current year. One layer is for the line and the other for the\n    points. This is explained n=in more detail in Chapter 8.\n\n[^46]: This might have been corrected by the time you read this section.\n\n[^47]: The resulting column is slightly incorrect, because of the\n    multiple stations. The last 2 rows (hours) at each station should be\n    missing, but they continue with the values from the next station.\n    This will have a negligible effect on subsequent calculations. If\n    you wish to be strictly correct, then filter for these last 2 days\n    and set the values as missing.\n\n[^48]: The calculation of the baseline values is more complex in two\n    ways. First is that each day uses the data from the 5 surrounding\n    days, e.g. for 10^th^ January, the data are used from 8^th^ to\n    12^th^ January. There are therefore 150 values for each day, from\n    which to calculate the 10% and 90% points. Second is that a\n    bootstrapping methods is used, following (Zhang, Hegerl, Zwiers, &\n    Kenyon, 2005) where each year in turn is omitted and replaced by one\n    of the other 29 years.\n\n[^49]: If you have multiple data frames open, and you just want to close\n    this one, then use ***Right-Click*** on the data frame tab (at the\n    bottom of the data) and choose ***Delete***.\n\n[^50]: With the default of more than 9 days, there is no planting date\n    in 2 of the years. This is possible, and the issue us discussed in\n    Section 7.4. Here we avoid the discussion!\n\n[^51]: A caption can be split over multiple lines if \\\\n is used as a\n    line feed.\n\n[^52]: You may wonder why they are not always the same. They are within\n    a day of each other and we consider that is \"good enough\" for the\n    uses of the results. They sometimes differ by a day for one (or\n    both) of 2 reasons. First the length =End -- Start. So, if the Start\n    was 14 Nov, and the End was 16^th^, then Length = 2 days. But 3 days\n    are used in the calculation of the sum, from the start day to the\n    end day. Second -- and the other way -- is that February 29 is an\n    extra day in non-leap years for calculating the length, but not for\n    the number of days in calculating the sum. So, in Fig. 12.4s the\n    results are the same in non-leap years, and different, by one day,\n    in leap years.\n\n[^53]: From the dates, use ***Prepare \\> Column: Calculate\n    \\>Calculation*** to find the month of the maximum. ***Label*** the\n    month and ***reorder***, so December is first. Then, in the\n    ***Climatic \\> PICSA \\> Rainfall Graph***, use ***Plot Options***\n    and edit the points layer to include the month in the graph.\n\n[^54]: Changed geom_line, to geom_col, colour to black, and size=0.8 to\n    width=0.05 in PICSA line chart.\n\n[^55]: You could simply count the number of years in Fig. 12.4i when\n    planting is on or before each day number. Or count from a graphical\n    display, such as Fig. 12.4j. This is simpler from a cumulative\n    display of the starting dates, using the ***Climatic \\> PICSA \\>\n    Cumulative/Exceedance Graph***. Numerically you could give a logical\n    expression using the calculator, ***Prepare \\> Column: Calculate \\>\n    Calculation***, or using the proportion summary in ***Prepare \\>\n    Column Calculate \\> Column Summaries***.\n\n[^56]: The order of the factor levels is changed to go from South to\n    North (i.e. in latitude order). A Date column has been added (with\n    Climatic \\> Dates \\> Make Date, and just use the Year column. Then\n    the data frame is defined as climatic, as described in Chapter 8.\n\n[^57]: It isn't difficult. First use ***Climatic \\> Dates \\> Make\n    Date*** for the daily data, (possibly change the year and doy to be\n    numeric) then, ***Use Date*** to get the monthly variable. Then\n    repeat the plot with the ***month as a facet***.\n\n[^58]: The scale option was used to make the width proportional to the\n    count of observations at each direction.\n\n[^59]: This is Precip ≥ 0.01 inches as the US uses inches rather than\n    mm. (1 inch = 25.4mm).\n\n[^60]: Here the total rainfall is calculated from ***all*** the rain\n    days -- i.e. even those with less than 0.85mm. This slightly higher\n    than the totals ignoring those days completely, i.e. setting those\n    values to zero. If you wish to set those values to zero, then, with\n    the daily data, generate a new variable, say rain0 using ***Prepare\n    \\> Column: Calculate \\> Calculation*** with the formula\n    ***(rain\\>0.85) \\* rain*** or equivalently ***ifelse(rain\\>0.85,\n    rain, 0)***.\n\n[^61]: There were some simple steps to produce the graph in Fig. 19.2n,\n    from the data in Fig. 19.2m, as follows. First subtract successive\n    columns to give the number of days between 1mm and 5mm, etc. Then\n    use Climatic \\> Tidy and Examine \\> Stack on these four variables,\n    carrying the Month factor. Then produce the stacked bar chart. It is\n    good if the chart is in the \"right order\", both for the bars and the\n    legend, and this may involve the Prepare \\> Column: Factor \\>\n    Reorder Levels.\n\n[^62]: Some countries continue to use a tighter rule where 5 is the\n    maximum number of missing days permitted in a month, or 3\n    consecutive days.\n\n[^63]: If the checkbox is not (yet) enabled, then press Ok for the\n    existing summary. Use the dialogue again, make date the element and\n    choose Minimum. This has given the column called min_date in Fig.\n
