It was\ndescribed briefly in Chapter 1 and Fig. 12.1a is a repeat of Fig. 1.6a\nto show the different stages of the PICSA activity.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.1a Stages of the PICSA project***\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.1a.png){width=\"4.880428696412948in\"\n  height=\"3.5892180664916884in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPICSA has been used in many countries in Africa and beyond, including\nTanzania, Malawi, Lesotho, Ghana, Guyana, Rwanda, Haiti and Bangladesh.\nAt first glance it may seem like many other initiatives to share climate\ninformation with farmers. It has some distinguishing features, that\nexplain its inclusion in this guide.\n\nThe first distinguishing feature is the large set of activities that are\nundertaken prior to the availability of the seasonal forecast. They\nbuild on the information from the historical climatic data. There is a\ndetailed instruction guide, with 12 sections. The first 7 are shown in\nFig. 12.1b and take place in the \"Long-before-the- season\", step shown\nin Fig. 12.1a.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.1b***\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.1b.png){width=\"5.551943350831146in\"\n  height=\"3.387387357830271in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe second distinguishing feature is that PICSA supports farmer's\nactivities in relation to crops, livestock or other livelihood\nactivities. It identifies options and is not directed towards any\nparticular crop or activity. This is indicated in Step d) of Fig. 12.1b.\n\nThird is the emphasis on \"options by context\" that places the farmer\n(and not the \"expert\") at the centre. Thus, PICSA does not make\nrecommendations for the farmers. Instead it offers options, with the\nidea, shown in steps d and e, in Fig. 12.1b, that the farmers, or\nhouseholds, may wish to select those that particularly fit their\ncircumstances. Fig. 12.1c shows an example of options related to\nlivelihood activities.\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.1c***                                        ***Fig. 12.1d***\n  ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.1c.png){width=\"3.363928258967629in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.1d.png){width=\"2.6359897200349955in\"\n  height=\"2.814714566929134in\"}                          height=\"2.800184820647419in\"}\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThese options are not pre-selected but are constructed through dialogues\nbetween the farmers and extension workers. Farmers evaluate options via\na set of participatory exercises. One is a resource allocation map\n(RAM), step a) in Fig. 12.1b, an example of which is in Fig. 12.1d.\n\nFurther information on PICSA is available via the website\n[[https://research.reading.ac.uk/picsa/]{.underline}](https://research.reading.ac.uk/picsa/),\nFig. 12.1e. Information includes the field manual, from which Fig. 12.1b\nshows the first 7 sections. This is currently available in 4 languages,\nnamely English, Bengali, French and Spanish.\n\nThe idea, in PICSA, is that by step g, in Fig. 12.1b, the farmer has\nprovisional plans for the season. These could apply to any season. These\nplans may then be modified by the extra information for this season,\nfrom the seasonal forecast, discussed in Chapter 13.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.1e The PICSA webpage***\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.1e.png){width=\"6.078515966754156in\"\n  height=\"2.4789512248468943in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this chapter we mainly consider Steps b and c from Fig. 12.1b. This\nis a discussion of the historical temperature and rainfall data, both in\nrelation to climate change (Step b) and then to consider the risks from\ndifferent options (Step c).\n\n## Climate change and variability \n\nIn PICSA it has been useful for farmers to examine and use the\nhistorical graphs themselves, e.g. Fig. 12.2a. Some have had little or\nno formal education, but almost all have been able to follow and\ninterpret the ideas of these time series graphs.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.2a***\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.2a.png){width=\"5.957272528433946in\"\n  height=\"3.622808398950131in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStep b, in Fig. 12.1b is one of comparing farmers (and extension\nworkers) perceptions of climate change with the evidence from the\nhistorical climatic records.\n\nMany farmers, NGO and extension staff already have strong views on\nclimate change. However, most have never seen any of the time series\ngraphs of the type shown in Fig. 12.2b and Fig. 12.2c.\n\nTemperatures usually show a clear trend, illustrated by Tmin in Fig.\n12.2b. For rainfall the message is usually one of variability, Fig.\n12.2c, rather than trend, being the main concern. This is a surprise for\nsome, who interprete climate change as implying a change in the pattern\nof rainfall. This is partly because rainfall is by far the most\nimportant climatic element for tropical agriculture.\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.2b Tmax and Tmin, Dodoma***                                     ***Fig. 12.2c Total annual rainfall, Dodoma***\n  ---------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.2b.png){width=\"2.729400699912511in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.2c.png){width=\"3.0078958880139983in\"\n  height=\"3.16913823272091in\"}                         height=\"3.004401793525809in\"}\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOf course, if there is a trend in temperatures, then this ***is***\nclimate change. The climatic elements are interlinked, hence there must\nbe a corresponding change in the other elements, including rainfall.\nHowever, rainfall is so variable from year to year, that any change is\noften not detectable. In addition, unlike temperatures, that are rising,\nthe changes in the patterns of rainfall will not be so simple -some\nplaces will become wetter and others dryer.\n\nHence, in most sites where PICSA has been used, many of the activities,\ni.e. the options for farming households, are designed to manage the\nrainfall risks, (i.e. variability), rather than change.\n\nThere is an important corollary to this idea. It is easy to blame\nclimate change \"on the West\" and hence assume it is a problem for others\nto solve. But rainfall variability, as shown in Fig. 12.2c, is a problem\nfaced locally by successive generations. Hence discussing options to\nmanage the risks is sensible for individual farmers to consider.\n\nThis type of discussion, within PICSA, is constructive for both the\nintermediaries (NGO and extension staff) and farmers in encouraging an\nopenness to consider changes in their activities, i.e. to consider what\noptions might be useful to manage the (rainfall) risks. This idea is\nwell phrased in the ICRISAT study, (Cooper, et al., 2008). They claim\nthat managing the current climate risks has a double benefit. It is\nuseful itself, as well as preparing farmers for future climate change.\n\nAn initial one-week workshop is often used to introduce PICSA in a new\ncountry, or in a new district, within a country. The graphs, such as\nFig. 12.2b and Fig. 12.2cc are usually part of the materials from the\nfirst day.\n\n## Producing the initial graphs - no data issues\n\nCurrently a key input in PICSA is a series of time-series graphs on\naspects of the rainfall that are of direct interest, and support farmers\nin their choice of options. They don't just look at the graphs, but also\nuse them, as shown in Fig 12.2a, to calculate risks for themselves.\n\nFor many farmers, also for intermediaries, this is the first time they\nhave seen this type of time-series graph. Hence, as mentioned above, it\nusually serves two purposes. The first is as a practical demonstration,\nthat (for the rainfall) the main issue is one of variability, rather\nthan change. Hence \"the ball is in their court\" to manage their climatic\nrisks, rather than being part of the general topic of climate change.\nThe second is as a tool to calculate the risks for alternative options.\n\nThese graphs are usually prepared by staff from the corresponding NMS.\nCurrently the work is often by NMS headquarters staff, but perhaps LMS\nstaff based locally may be able to do some of this work in the future.\nThe production is simple when there are no \"data issues\" and is\ndescribed in this section.\n\nA checklist may useful, and an initial version is in Table 12.3a. Start\nwith this list, and then edit to produce your own.\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Table 12.3a                                     \n  Initial                                            \n  checklist***                                       \n  -------------- ----------------------------------- ------------------------------\n  ***Step***     ***Action***                        ***R-Instat Dialogue***\n\n  1              Read the data into R-Instat         File \\> Open from File\n\n  2              Check the data as input             Climatic \\> Tidy and Examine\n                                                     \\>\\\n                                                     One Variable Summarise\n\n  3              Make a date variable                Climatic \\> Dates \\> Make Date\n\n  4              Infill if dates are absent          Climatic \\> Dates \\> Infill\n\n  5              Make further date variables         Climatic \\> Dates \\> Use Date\n                 (possibly shifted)                  \n\n  6              Probably delete the initial year,   Right-click, then Delete and\n                 month, day variables, plus further  Reorder variables\n                 \"housekeeping\"                      \n\n  7              Define the data as climatic         Climatic \\> Define Climatic\n                                                     Data\n\n  8              Omitting Check Data, because data   Could add:\\\n                 are ok!

If the data file only has rainfall, then omit steps 12 and 13.\n\nThe data from Tanzania were supplied as an Excel file as shown in Fig.\n12.3b. This was exported from Clidata (Tolatz, 2019) and is in the\n\"right shape\" for R-Instat, i.e. each row of data is for one day and the\nfour elements are in successive columns.\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3a***                                        ***Fig. 12.3b***\n  ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3a.png){width=\"2.1945570866141733in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3b.png){width=\"3.8149748468941382in\"\n  height=\"2.2015015310586175in\"}                          height=\"2.8353357392825895in\"}\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse ***File \\> Open from File*** to input your data.\n\nTo practice with these data, use ***Open from Library \\> Instat \\>\nBrowse \\> Climatic \\>Tanzania*** and open the ***Dodoma18.xlsx*** file,\nFig. 12.3c.\n\nWe first make a deliberate mistake. If you are following the exercise,\nthen we strongly recommend that you make this mistake also. It is very\ncommon!\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3c Importing from Excel***                                        ***Fig. 12.3d Data imported incorrectly***\n  ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3c.png){width=\"3.363928258967629in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3d.png){width=\"2.6359897200349955in\"\n  height=\"2.814714566929134in\"}                          height=\"2.800184820647419in\"}\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Fig. 12.3c the data frame preview indicates something is wrong,\nbecause there are m values present. This is not always so obvious,\nbecause only 10 lines are shown, which may not include missing values.\n\nPress ***Ok*** to import that data. The problem is now shown, in\nR-Instat, by the (c) after SUNHRS(c) and TMPMIN(c) and TMPMAX(c). These\nvariables are numeric but have been imported as character (text)\nvariables, because there are some non-numeric characters in these\ncolumns.\n\nYou can correct this problem in R-Instat, but it is simpler to correct\nwhen you import the data, or in Excel. Here it is easy to correct when\nthe data are imported.\n\nSo, use ***File \\> Close Data File***[^49]. Then recall the last\ndialogue to give Fig. 12.3c again and insert ***m*** as the ***Missing\nValue String***, Fig. 12.3c. The preview changes to show NA instead of\nm. Press ***Ok*** and the variables are imported correctly.\n\nUse the climatic menu, Fig. 12.3e and item 2 in the checklist, see Table\n12.3a. Start with the ***Tidy and Examine*** menu, Fig. 12.3e. The data\nhere are already tidy, hence move straight to the ***One Variable\nSummarise Dialogue***. If your data are in a \"different shape\" some of\nthe other dialogues in this menu may be needed.\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3e The Tidy and Examine Menu***                                        ***Fig. 12.3f One Variable Summarise***\n  ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3e.png){width=\"2.9702985564304463in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3f.png){width=\"2.7105074365704285in\"\n  height=\"2.4269542869641296in\"}                          height=\"2.8048304899387575in\"}\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe results are in Fig. 12.3g. They are promising, because of the\nfollowing:\n\na)  There are no missing values in the Year, Month, Day variables. It\n    would be a problem if there were.\n\nb)  Amazingly the rainfall variable is also complete. This is great, but\n    rare. There are missing values in the other elements, partly because\n    they started later than the rainfall.\n\nc)  However, the Station name was imported as a character, and not a\n    factor variable.\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3g Results from Summary -- Step 2 in        ***Fig. 12.3h Name as Factor***\n  checklist***                                           \n  ------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3g.png){width=\"4.383143044619422in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3h.png){width=\"1.6977471566054243in\"\n  height=\"2.081823053368329in\"}                          height=\"2.714501312335958in\"}\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Station name is not a problem here, because there is only one\nstation. However, it is still made into a Factor variable for\ncompleteness, Fig. 12.3h. This is important when there are multiple\nstations in the same file.\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3i***                                        ***Fig. 12.3j***\n  ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3i.png){width=\"2.7324212598425195in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3j.png){width=\"3.1415496500437445in\"\n  height=\"1.6530107174103237in\"}                          height=\"3.01915135608049in\"}\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe ***Climatic \\> Date*** menu, Fig. 12.3i is used for Steps 3 to 5 in\nthe checklist, Table 12.3a. First calculate a single Date variable, i.e.\na Variable of Type (D). Here it is calculated from the 3 variables,\ngiving the YEAR, MONTH and DAY as shown in Fig. 12.3j.\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3k Infilling where dates are omitted***                                        ***Fig. 12.3l Adding variables from the date***\n  ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3k.png){width=\"3.102471566054243in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3l.png){width=\"2.859963910761155in\"\n  height=\"2.9833847331583554in\"}                          height=\"4.37336176727909in\"}\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNext -- Step 4 - is to check for any gaps in the data, using ***Climatic\n\\> Dates \\> Infill Missing Dates***, Fig. 12.3k. They are absent dates\nin the file, for example a year being absent. This is separate from the\ndates being complete, but with missing values in the data.\n\nIn this case the result was that there was nothing to infill. Proceed to\nStep 5 with ***Climatic \\> Dates \\> Use Date***, Fig. 12.3l. Dodoma is\nin the southern hemisphere, with a single rainy season from November to\nApril. Hence, in Fig. 12.3l, the year is shifted to start in July. Five\nvariables are generated, as shown in Fig. 12.3l.\n\nNow a little \"housekeeping\", Step 6 in the checklist. ***Right-click***\nand ***delete*** the 3 original YEAR, MONTH DAY variables and re-order\nthe remaining variables, Fig. 12.3m, so the measurements are last. This\nis a convenient, and not an essential step.\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3m***                                       ***Fig. 12.3n***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3m.png){width=\"2.459254155730534in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3n.png){width=\"3.5132097550306214in\"\n  height=\"1.949679571303587in\"}                          height=\"2.354465223097113in\"}\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe data are shown in Fig. 12.3n. They are now ready for Step 7, which\nis to define the data as climatic, as shown in Fig. 12.3o.\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3o Defining a data frame as climatic***                                       ***Fig. 12.3p The Check Data Menu***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3o.png){width=\"3.073804680664917in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3p.png){width=\"2.909319772528434in\"\n  height=\"3.739970472440945in\"}                          height=\"1.7850229658792651in\"}\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe ***Climatic \\>*** ***Define Climatic Data*** dialogue should largely\nbe filled automatically. Check carefully this it has the variables you\nwill be using in the future analyses. Check, especially, the variable\nfor the Station names and those for the dates. Then ***press the Check\nUnique button***.\n\nIn this check, green is a good colour as is shown in Fig. 12.3o. This\ncheck verifies that the combination of Station name and Date can become\nkey fields in this data frame. If not, then it is likely that you have\nsome duplicates in the data. Duplicates are days (rows) in the file\nwhere a date has been given twice. Then you need to return to the\n***Climatic \\> Tidy and Explore*** menu as we discuss in Section 12.6.\n\nIn the checklist, Table 12.3a you now usually move to the ***Climatic \\>\nCheck Data*** menu, Fig 12.3p. This is described in detail in Chapter 5,\nand we return to this menu in Section 12.6. It is omitted here to\nproceed quickly to the production of the variables and graphs needed for\nPICSA.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3q***                                        ***Fig. 12.3r***\n  ------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3q.png){width=\"3.1966568241469817in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3r.png){width=\"2.34839457567804in\"\n  height=\"2.9785728346456692in\"}                          height=\"3.0432392825896764in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHence, move to Step 9 in the checklist, i.e. the ***Climatic \\>\nPrepare*** menu, Fig. 12.3q. The ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Transform***\ndialogue, Fig. 12.3r is used first as explained below.\n\nComplete Fig. 12.3r as shown and press ***Ok***. This produces a new\nvariable, called ***rainday***, that takes the value 1 when it is rainy\n-- defined here as a day with more than 0.85mm. It is zero otherwise, as\nshown in Fig. 12.3s. This is used for graphs of the number of rain days.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3s Saving the data***                                        ***Fig. 12.3t Save the RDS file***\n  ------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3s.png){width=\"2.8975043744531934in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3t.png){width=\"3.153951224846894in\"\n  height=\"1.8040365266841645in\"}                          height=\"0.9491251093613299in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThese data are now saved as an R file, i.e. with an RDS extension. Use\n***File \\> Save As \\> Save Data As***, Fig. 12.3s to give the dialogue\nshown in Fig. 12.3t. ***Browse*** to where you want to save the data.\nOnce you click ***Save*** on that dialogue, you return automatically to\nFig. 12.3t and ***click Ok*** to make the Save.\n\nOnce the data are saved, then re-open these saved data, to continue the\nwork on a future occasion. The first 10 steps do not have to be repeated\n\nThese steps, so far, have been described in detail. In practice, once\nthey become routine, they typically take 5 minutes or less. If problems\nare found during the process, then we strongly recommend you consider\nmaking corrections in the database, or (less comfortably) in an Excel\nfile, and then start the checklist again.\n\nIf you are following these steps with the Dodoma data, then it is time\nto substitute a further data set. The data used, so far, was of very\ngood quality, but there were still some issues, that we discuss in\nSection 12.6. Hence use ***File \\> Open From Library \\> Instat \\> Browse\n\\> Climatic \\> Tanzania*** again and choose the file called\n***Dodoma18c***. The data are the same, except 2 more variables are\nadded, with the corrected temperature data. These new variables are\ncalled Tmax and Tmin.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3u Rainfall and temperature summaries***                                        ***Fig. 12.3v Day range sub-dialogue***\n  ------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3u.png){width=\"3.0173523622047242in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3v.png){width=\"2.9682020997375327in\"\n  height=\"3.719714566929134in\"}                          height=\"2.7967705599300086in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next steps, 11 and 12 in the checklist, both use the ***Climatic \\>\nPrepare \\> Climatic Summaries*** dialogue, Fig. 12.3u\n\nTwo important decisions are i) whether the summaries are to be for the\nwhole (shifted) year, or perhaps just for the rainy season? Then ii) how\nyou will handle missing values in the data.\n\nIn Fig. 12.3u we choose to get all summaries for the ***rain variable***\nfor the 6 months of the rainy season, from November to April. Hence\nclick on the ***Day Range*** button in Fig. 12.3u.\n\nIn the sub-dialogue in Fig. 12.3v, choose the range to be ***November\n1st to April 30th***. After pressing ***Return*** you see that the day\nrange is now 6 months, from the shifted day number 124 to day 305, i.e.\nabout 182 days.\n\nNow, in Fig. 12.3u, check the ***Omit Missing Values checkbox***. Then\nclick on the ***Summaries button***, and then on the ***Missing Tab***,\nFig. 12.3w. Set it, as shown in Fig. 12.3w, to about 160 days. This\npermits a few missing values, but not a complete month missing.\n\nThen, in the same sub-dialogue, click on the ***Summaries tab*** and\njust have the ***N-Non Missing*** and the ***Sum*** checked, as shown in\nFig. 12.3x.\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3w Missing values tab***                    ***Fig. 12.3x Summaries calculated***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3w.png){width=\"2.949481627296588in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3x.png){width=\"3.1188287401574804in\"\n  height=\"1.9575754593175854in\"}                         height=\"2.7169477252843395in\"}\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPressing Ok in the dialogue in Fig. 12.3u results in a new data frame\nwith 4 variables and 85 rows, Fig. 12.3y, because there are 85 years\n(seasons) of data. The summary for the first year (1934/35 season) is\nmissing. This may come as a slight surprise, because there are no\nmissing values in the rainfall data. However, the record starts on 1\nJanuary 1935, which therefore does not have November or December of the\n1934/35 season.\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3y***                                       ***Fig. 12.3z***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3y.png){width=\"1.984459755030621in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3z.png){width=\"3.9305555555555554in\"\n  height=\"3.0939971566054245in\"}                         height=\"3.126576990376203in\"}\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReturn to the same dialogue (***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Climatic\nSummaries***) to add 3 more summaries.\n\na)  Change the ***rain*** to the ***rainday*** variable in the main\n    dialogue, Fig. 12.3u. Press Ok.\n\nb)  Change the element to ***Tmin*** and change the ***Summary*** to the\n    ***Mean***, (rather than the Sum). Press ***Ok***.\n\nc)  Change the element to ***Tmax***. Press Ok.\n\nThe results are in Fig. 12.3z. They show, for example, that in the\n1962-63 season (November to April) there was a total of 422mm rain from\n41 rain days, hence an average of just over 10mm per rain day. The value\nof Tmin could not be given, because there were only 147 non-missing days\nin that season. The mean for Tmax was 29.4˚C.\n\nFinally, in this initial checklist, give the corresponding graphs. For\nthe temperature data there is not yet a special climatic dialogue, so\nuse ***Describe \\> Specific \\> Line Plot***, as shown in Fig. 12.3aa.\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3aa***                                       ***Fig. 12.3ab***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3aa.png){width=\"2.9165726159230094in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3ab.png){width=\"3.211813210848644in\"\n  height=\"3.036790244969379in\"}                         height=\"3.0356714785651793in\"}\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Fig. 12.3aa the ***Multiple Variables*** option is used to facilitate\nplotting Tmax and Tmin together. ***Points are added***, as is a ***line\nof best fit***. The ***Data Options*** button is also used to\n***filter*** the data to just ***s_year \\> 1957***.\n\nThe resulting graph is shown in Fig. 12.3ab. It indicates an increase of\ntemperatures, with Tmin having a higher slope than Tmax. The analysis of\nthe temperature data and the presentation of the corresponding PICSA\ngraphs is considered further in Section 12.5.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3ac Remove filter***                       ***Fig. 12.3ad The Climatic \\> PICSA dialogues***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3ac.png){width=\"2.43494750656168in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3ad.png){width=\"3.483146325459318in\"\n  height=\"2.9829297900262466in\"}                        height=\"2.312853237095363in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore doing a rainfall graph use ***Right-click*** and the last option\nis to ***Remove Current Filter***, Fig. 12.3ac.\n\nThen use ***Climatic \\> PICSA \\> Rainfall Graph***, Fig 12.3ad. Graph\nthe variable called sum_rain, Fig. 12.3ae. Then use the ***PICSA\nOptions*** button to add a horizontal line for the mean, Fig. 12.3af.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3ae***                       ***Fig. 12.3af***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3ae.png){width=\"2.8456485126859143in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.3af.png){width=\"3.093505030621172in\"\n  height=\"2.7895516185476814in\"}                        height=\"2.1058464566929134in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resulting graph is shown in Fig. 12.3ag. Return to the ***Climatic\n\\> PICSA \\> Rainfall Graph*** dialogue and substitute the\n***sum_rainday*** variable to give a similar graph of the seasonal\nnumber of rain-days.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.3ag PICSA graphs of the seasonal totals and number of rain\n  days***\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.3ag.png){width=\"5.721399825021872in\"\n  height=\"4.006120953630796in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \nThe results are in Fig. 12.3ag. They show that the mean rainfall total\nwas about 560mm from an average of just over 40 rain days. This is an\naverage of about 7 rain days per month, roughly one day in 4. This is\nsufficiently low that it is likely that there are often long dry spells\nduring the season.\n\nWe have produced our first \"PICSA-style\" graphs. Further graphs are\nproduced in the next Section, together with ways of making the graphs\nappropriate for the extension staff and for farmers.\n\n## The rainy season\n\nIn this section we consider the production of further rainfall summaries\nwith the ***Climatic \\> Prepare*** menu and the corresponding graphs\nfrom the ***Climatic \\> PICSA*** menu.\n\nUsually between 6 and 8 graphs are prepared and discussed on the first\nday of the main PICSA workshop. They all have the same format as shown\nin Fig. 12.3ag and are designed to look consistent. The x-axis is the\nyears (or seasons) and the y-axis is for something of interest. They\nusually include a rainfall total, Fig. 12.3ag together with the start,\nend and length of the rainy season. There are then one or two graphs of\nevents within the season, for example the length of the longest dry\nspell or the most extreme daily rainfall.\n\nDefinitions can be changed easily. PICSA encourages \"options by context\"\nand this can apply to households and or crops having different\ndefinitions for the start of the rains, and for any other\ncharacteristic.\n\nThe graphs are also used on the \"practice with farmers day\", during the\nworkshop, usually day 4. Following the workshop, the agreed graphs are\nthen used by the extension staff or farmer's representatives to share\nwith individuals or groups of farmers.\n\nWe continue with the data from Dodoma, used in Section 12.3.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.4a Start of the rains***                       ***Fig. 12.4b Adding a dry-spell condition***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.4a.png){width=\"3.4121161417322834in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.4b.png){width=\"2.573474409448819in\"\n  height=\"3.154821741032371in\"}                        height=\"2.9682469378827645in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Start of the Rains***, Fig. 12.4a. A range\nof definitions of the Start of the rains is discussed in Section 7.3. In\n2019, in Malawi and Tanzania the definitions used were:\n\n-   Malawi: First occasion from 1 October with 25mm or more in 3 days.\n\n-   Tanzania: First occasion from 15 November with 20mm in 4 days, of\n    which 2 days were rainy.\n\nWe here use the same as Tanzania. Hence click on the ***Day Range*** in\nFig. 12.4a and set the earliest date to ***15 November***. Make the\nlatest date ***29 February***. Then ***complete the dialogue*** as shown\nin Fig. 12.4a and press ***Ok***.\n\nThis generates 2 new variables, the first with the day number in the\n(shifted) year and the second giving the corresponding date.\n\nReturn to the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Start of the Rains*** dialogue\nand add the dry-spells condition, Fig. 12.4b. Change the default of 9\ndays to 10 days as the maximum allowable spell[^50]. Also change the\nnames of the resulting variables, or the events produced before will be\noverwritten.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.4c End of the rains***                       ***Fig. 12.4d***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.4c.png){width=\"3.0006211723534557in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.4d.png){width=\"2.9240430883639545in\"\n  height=\"3.02583552055993in\"}                        height=\"2.478840769903762in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+\n| ***Fig. 12.4c End of the rains*** | ***Fig. 12.4d***                 |\n|                                   |                                  |\n| ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> End of  |                                  |\n| the Rains***                      |                                  |\n+===================================+==================================+\n| ![](media/image1343.              | ![](media/image1341.p            |\n| png){width=\"3.0006211723534557in\" | ng){width=\"2.9240430883639545in\" |\n| height=\"3.02583552055993in\"}      | height=\"2.478840769903762in\"}    |\n+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+\n\nIn Chapter 7 we discuss the use of these alternative definitions of the\nstart. Here we simply choose one of them -- for the next PICSA graph. We\nquickly also get data on the end and length of the season.\n\nIn many countries we use a simple water-balance definition of the end of\nthe rains/season. This does not work well in Southern Africa, as\nexplained in Section 7.4. Hence here we use the method proposed by\n(Mupamgwa, Walker, & Twomlow, 2011).\n\nSo, complete the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> End of the Rains*** dialogue\nas shown in Fig. 12.4c. In the ***Day Range*** use ***15 February to 30\nJune***.\n\nThen use ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Length of the Season***, Fig. 12.4d\nand complete as shown.\n\nThe results have added variables to the annual data frame, Fig. 12.4e.\nThe year indicated shows that in the 1937/38 season there was a planting\nopportunity on day 174, (i.e. 21 December). But, if the dry-spell\ndefinition is included then the start was on 23rd January. The last\nheavy rainfall was on 31^st^ March, which was defined as the end of the\nrains/season, giving a season length of 101 days.\n\nGraphs can be produced assuming the user accepts the definitions.\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.4e The annual data frame***                  ***Fig. 12.4f A graph of the Start***\n  ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.4e.png){width=\"3.2341983814523183in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.4f.png){width=\"2.7932720909886264in\"\n  height=\"2.942286745406824in\"}                           height=\"2.8815354330708662in\"}\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUse ***Climatic \\> PICSA \\> Rainfall Graph*** for the variable\n***start_rain*** and complete as shown in Fig. 12.4f. Then complete the\n***PICSA options*** for the ***Y-axis*** and the ***Lines***, as shown\nin Fig. 12.4g and 12.4h.\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.4g***                                       ***Fig. 12.4h***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.4g.png){width=\"2.811955380577428in\"\n![](figures/Fig 12.4f.png){width=\"2.9353149606299214in\"\n  height=\"2.2885793963254595in\"}                         height=\"2.232117235345582in\"}\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resulting graph is in Fig. 12.4i.

For\n    example, should the 15 Nov be the earliest possible starting date,\n    given that quite a lot of seasons had a starting opportunity very\n    close to this earliest date. Or should the dry spell have been\n    included.\\\n    It is easy to try the graph with the dry spell included. Just return\n    to the ***Climatic \\> PICSA \\> Rainfall Graph*** dialogue,\n    substitute the start_dry variable and press Ok to give the graph in\n    Fig. 12.4j. The mean starting date is now about a week later and\n    there are considerably more years that do not have a successful\n    start until January.

Hence the start was indeed on 6^th^ February.\n\nc)  Is the graph as clear as possible for the intended PICSA audience?\n    This is what we address here.\n\nAn example of a graph with additional options is in Fig. 12.4l.

The season\nlength was calculated earlier, Fig. 12.4e and is plotted in Fig. 12.4o.\nThe median length at Dodoma was about 4 months and varies between 2 and\n6 months.\n\nThe total rainfall within the season is sometimes requested. This is the\nrainfall between the start dates and the end dates. This again uses the\n***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Climatic Summaries***, as shown in Fig. 12.4p.\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.4p Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Summaries***                                        ***Fig. 12.4q Day Range from start to end***\n  ------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.4n.png){width=\"2.4361231408573927in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.4o.png){width=\"3.6065048118985126in\"\n  height=\"3.1956178915135607in\"}                           height=\"2.3646872265966756in\"}\n\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe difference here, from the summaries given earlier, is the choice of\nthe dates, from the ***Day Range*** button in Fig. 12.4q.

In this summary, the variable called ***count_rain*** is the\nnumber of days used for the sum and is almost the same as the length --\nwhich is also given in Fig. 12.4s. It should be the same, because it is\nsimply counting the number of days used for that calculation, i.e.\nbetween the start and end dates. It is thus effectively another way of\nfinding the length[^52].\n\nThe resulting graph is shown in Fig. 12.4t.\n\nAn attractive way these results can be used is shown in Fig. 12.4u. The\ndata, from Fig. 12.4s, can be transferred to an interactive app which\n(unlike R-Instat) is available for a smart-phone. In Fig. 12.4u the user\ncan move the slider, shown at 600mm to find the risks for any given\nseasonal rainfall required.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.4u***\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.4u.png){width=\"6.148199912510936in\"\n  height=\"2.9562587489063867in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is an obvious graph and is often proposed for PICSA. However, it is\ncomplicated, as it is composed of three elements, namely the start, the\nend, and then the totals within this period, that varies from season to\nseason. We often find it is not very different to the graph with fixed\nend points, such as Fig. 12.3ag that gave the totals from November to\nApril.\n\nThese graphs, from the start to the end may be more relevant for sites\nwhere there is a bimodal pattern of rainfall. Even then that would be\n\"in competition\" with simpler graphs giving the totals for fixed\nperiods, say from October to December and then for March to May.\n\nWe return to the possible use of the facility for variable dates in the\nSection 12.5.\n\nThis same facility for flexible choice of the starting and ending dates\nis available in other dialogues and the longest dry-spell length during\nthe season is an obvious graph.\n\nThe ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Spells*** dialogue is shown in Fig. 12.4v.\nThe ***Day Range*** is completed as shown earlier in Fig. 12.4r. The\ngraph of the spell lengths, using Climatic \\> PICSA \\> Rainfall Graphs\nis then shown in Fig. 12.4 w. The median for the longest spell length in\nthe season is 2.5 weeks and about 1 year in 7 has a dry spell of 25 days\nor more.\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.4v Dry spells during the season***                                       ***Fig. 12.4w Graph of maximum spell lengths***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.4v.png){width=\"2.5910148731408573in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.4w.png){width=\"3.4119761592300963in\"\n  height=\"3.0473589238845142in\"}                         height=\"3.088657042869641in\"}\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Extremes dialogue facilitates a study of\nextreme events.

The first\nstep is for the Ministry of Agriculture or elsewhere to provide the\ninformation in the first 4 columns of Table 12.7a. This specifies\nvarious crops (options for PICSA farmers) together their length and\nwater requirement. For example, the local variety of maize is a 120-day\ncrop and needs 480mm water. Alternatively, a possible variety of sorghum\nis 110 days and needs 300mm.\n\nThe calculations in this section provide the risks from specified dates\nof planting. In the last column of Table 12.7a the chance of success\nfrom a late planting is just one year in 5 for the local maize, compared\nto 3 years in 5 for the sorghum.\n\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  **Table                                                                   \n  12.7a                                                                     \n  Example                                                                   \n  crop                                                                      \n  table**                                                                   \n  ---------- ------------- ------------ ---------- ----------- ------------ ------------\n  **Crop**   **Variety**   **Days to    **Crop     **Chance of              \n                           maturity**   water need success if               \n                                        (mm)**     season                   \n                                                   starts:**                \n\n                                                   **on x      **on x       **on x\n                                                   (Early)**   (Middle)**   (Late)**\n\n  Maize      Local         120          480        5/10        4/10         2/10\n\n  Maize      Pioneer xxx   100          350        7/10        5/10         4/10\n\n  Sorghum    Seed Co xxx   110          300        8/10        7/10         6/10\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall, for a chosen planting date, there are 3 separate risks, as\nfollows:\n\n1.  Planting may not be possible by that date, i.e. the season starts\n    later.\n\n2.  There may not be time to grow the crop, i.e. the season ends too\n    early\n\n3.  There may be insufficient water in the time needed for the crop.\n\nThe crop will only be successful if none of these three risks occurs. We\ncall this the \"Overall risk\".\n\nA second possibility is the calculation of the risk of success if there\nis a planting opportunity on day x. In that case, just risks 2 and 3\napply. This is the \"Conditional risk\".\n\nThe example used is for Dodoma in Tanzania. Use ***File \\> Open from\nLibrary \\> Instat \\> Browse \\> Tanzania \\> Dodoma***.\n\nUse ***Climatic \\> Check Data \\> Boxplot*** as shown in Fig. 12.7a to\nshow the seasonal pattern of rainfall.

In the 1935/36 season there was\na planting opportunity on day 177, i.e. before our day 185 requirement.\nThe rainfall in the 90 days from day 185 was 357mm, which is sufficient\nand the end date of day 296 was also more than 90 days from the starting\ndate.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.7m***                                       ***Fig. 12.7n [Redo when no zero in first year]***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.7m.png){width=\"2.4111964129483816in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.7n.png){width=\"3.565169510061242in\"\n  height=\"2.10790135608049in\"}                          height=\"3.1352241907261593in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHence all 3 conditions were TRUE and hence the final column, called\n***overall_cond*** is also TRUE. This final variable is TRUE in xxx of\nthe 77 years that did not have missing data, giving the overall result\nof 0.412. [Change when corrected.]{.mark}\n\nThe 1947/48 season was one where the rainfall in the 90 days was just\n244mm and hence was insufficient. In 1949/50 the season was not long\nenough and in 1950/51 there was no starting opportunity by January\n1^st^. These years all contributed to the 6 years in 10 when the crop\nwould have had problems.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.7o***                                      ***Fig. 12.7p***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.7o.png){width=\"2.976654636920385in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.7p.png){width=\"2.935657261592301in\"\n  height=\"2.223937007874016in\"}                         height=\"3.0640923009623795in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReturn to the ***Climatic \\> PICSA \\> Crops*** dialogue and specify\nplanting dates from 1^st^ December to mid-January as shown in Fig.\n12.7o. There is also a range of crop water requirements, from 250 to\n400mm) and crop durations from 75 to 120 days. At other sites crops with\na greater water requirement and with longer season lengths could also be\nconsidered. For Dodoma, the initial graphs in Fig. 12.7b, 12.7f and\n12.7j suggest the range of values given in Fig. 12.7o.\n\nThe results, in the output window, are shown in Fig. 12.7p. They can be\ninterpreted here, but for presentation they are copied into Excel or to\nCalc (in Open Office). Copied from Fig. 12.7p they can be pasted into\nExcel, using the Import wizard. The results are shown in Fig. 12.7q\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.7q***                                      ***Fig. 12.7r***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.7q.png){width=\"3.011803368328959in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.7r.png){width=\"3.008370516185477in\"\n  height=\"1.499838145231846in\"}                         height=\"1.74082239720035in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Excel it is convenient to express the risks as fractions over 10\nyears as is shown in Fig. 12.7s. The results are in Fig. 12.7s. From\nFig. 12.7t we see that a 75 day crop that needed 250mm and planted in\n1^st^ December would be OK in 6 years out of 10. Later planting would\nslightly increase the chance of success.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.7s***                                      ***Fig. 12.7t Find the planting probabilities***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.7s.png){width=\"3.074582239720035in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.7t.png){width=\"2.857296587926509in\"\n  height=\"2.1449365704286962in\"}                        height=\"1.8919181977252844in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA 90-day crop with this same modest water requirement would have a\ngreater chance of success, if planted in December, but not if planting\nwere delayed till January.\n\nIt would be useful to include the chance of being able to plant by the\ndates given in Fig. 12.7t. A possible exercise in a training workshop is\nto consider how many different ways this can be found in R-Instat[^55].\nWe choose a bizarre, but simple way using the ***Climatic \\> PICSA \\>\nCrops*** dialogue as shown in Fig. 12.7u. Complete the dialogue as shown\nin Fig. 12.7u. This is just for the first day of the crop, when we\nassume it needs no water. So the only risk is from the planting day.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 12.7u***                                       ***Fig. 12.7v***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig12.7u.png){width=\"3.1308114610673665in\"   ![](figures/Fig12.7v.png){width=\"2.8979527559055116in\"\n  height=\"1.2700459317585302in\"}                         height=\"2.1428182414698163in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe results are in Fig. 12.7v. They show, for example that there is a\nplanting opportunity by 1 Jan in 9 years out of 10. This information is\nnow added to the table of crop risks, Fig. 12.7w. The interpretation is\nthat in 4 years in 10 there was a planting opportunity by 1^st^\nDecember. In a year when planting was possible on 1^st^ December the\nproportion of successes for a 75-day crop needing 250mm water was 6 out\nof 10.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"Chapter_13_PICSA__Long_Before_the_season.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
