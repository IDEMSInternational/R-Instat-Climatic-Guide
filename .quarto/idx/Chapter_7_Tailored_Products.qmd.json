{"title":"Tailored Products","markdown":{"headingText":"Tailored Products","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"## Introduction\n\nProducts by NMSs include regular reports, such as climate normal and\n10-day bulletins through the rainy season. It is useful if they also\nproduce \"tailored products\" that correspond to the specific demands of\nusers.\n\nIn many countries, one such product is the \"start of the rains\". This is\nusually not a single fixed definition but may depend on factors such as\nthe crop being planted and the type of soil. The results in this chapter\nare mainly based on an analysis of the daily rainfall data.\n\nIn early years on this type of work, e.g. (Stern, Dennett, & Dale, 1982)\nsome researchers questioned the need for the daily (rainfall) data. This\nwas often because sufficient results could be obtained through an\nanalysis of monthly totals supplemented, when needed, with 10-day\n(dekads) or weekly totals.\n\nThis was partly due to a mis-understanding that the analysis would use\nthe daily values directly. Instead, the daily values are simply used in\nan initial step to calculate appropriate summaries and these are on a\nyearly basis. The results are then presented in the same ways as the\nrainfall totals and total number of rain days in Chapter 6.\n\n## Getting ready\n\nOne of the examples used in this Chapter is from Moorings in Southern\nZambia. This has rainfall data from early 1922. Use ***Open From Library\n\\> Instat \\> Browse \\> Climatic \\> Zambia*** and open the file called\n***Moorings.rds***.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.2a***                                        ***Fig. 7.2b***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.2a.png){width=\"2.5082042869641294in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.2b.png){width=\"3.4951345144356956in\"\n  height=\"3.754517716535433in\"}                          height=\"3.6876377952755908in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA feature of Moorings, like many stations in Southern Africa, is that\nthe rainy season is from November to April. (This is roughly the mirror\nimage of the Sahel, where the rains are from May to October.) Hence the\nyear is \"shifted\" and we choose to start from August, Fig. 7.2a.\n\nUse the ***Climatic \\> Dates \\> Use Date*** dialogue, Fig. 7.2a, and\ncomplete as shown in Fig. 7.2b. Set the starting month to August.\n\nThe resulting data, after reordering the columns, is shown in Fig. 7.2b.\n\nIn Fig. 7.2b 1^st^ March 1922 is given as the season starting in 1921.\nThe year variable has also been given as a factor, to emphasise it is\nthe 1921-1922 season. The variable s_doy (shifted day of year) is 214 on\n1^st^ March. It is the day number in the season starting from 1^st^\nAugust as day 1.\n\nFinally, in Fig. 7.2b, there seems nothing different about the\n***month*** variable. But ***right-click*** on the column and choose\n***Levels/Labels***, Fig. 7.2c. This shows, Fig. 7.2d, that the months\nare now labelled from August, so all tables and graphs will now appear\nfrom August to July, rather than from January to December. ***Close***\nthe ***Levels/Labels*** dialogue.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.2c Choose Levels/Labels***                  ***Fig. 7.2d Factor levels start from August***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.2c.png){width=\"2.129636920384952in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.2d.png){width=\"3.157333770778653in\"\n  height=\"2.9701476377952756in\"}                        height=\"2.952107392825897in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow use the ***Climatic \\> Define Climatic Data*** dialogue.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.2e Define Moorings as Climatic***                  ***Fig. 7.2f The Climatic \\> Prepare Menu***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.2e.png){width=\"2.620744750656168in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.2f.png){width=\"3.168616579177603in\"\n  height=\"3.44834864391951in\"}                        height=\"2.981884295713036in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis dialogue should fill automatically, as shown in Fig. 7.2e. Check\nthat the dates define ***unique rows,*** Fig. 7.2e, and press ***Ok***.\n\nWe now assume use of the ***Climatic \\> Check Data*** dialogues,\ndescribed in Chapter 5, and go straight to the ***Climatic \\> Prepare***\nmenu, Fig. 7.2f***.*** Start with the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\>\nTransform*** dialogue, Fig. 7.2g. Complete it as shown to produce a new\nvariable, called rainday, see Fig. 7.2h, that facilitates the analysis\nof the number of rain days. A rain day is defined as one with more than\n0.85mm. You can choose a different threshold if you wish.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.2g***                                        ***Fig. 7.2h***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.2g.png){width=\"2.4147583114610676in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.2h.png){width=\"3.542851049868766in\"\n  height=\"3.2575568678915134in\"}                         height=\"3.2051870078740157in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow use the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\>*** ***Climatic Summaries***\ndialogue, Fig. 7.i\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.2i Getting annual summaries***                                        ***Fig. 7.2j Annual level data frame***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.2i.png){width=\"2.9917727471566056in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.2j.png){width=\"2.510919728783902in\"\n  height=\"3.5300656167979003in\"}                         height=\"3.577926509186352in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost of the dialogue, in Fig. 7.2i, should have completed automatically.\nIf not, then either the data frame was not defined as climatic, or you\nare on the wrong data frame.\n\nIn Fig. 7.2i, include the ***rain*** variable. Press the ***Summaries***\nbutton and choose just the ***Number not Missing*** and the ***Sum***.\nThe result should be a new annual data frame with 3 columns.\n\nIn Fig. 7.2i, change the variable to ***rainday*** and this time, just\nget the ***sum*** as the only summary.\n\nThe resulting annual data frame is shown in Fig. 7.2j. The results show,\nfor example, that the 1922/23 season had a total of 853mm from 75 rain\ndays. Further columns will now be added, that give the start of the\nrains each year, etc.\n\n## **Start of the rains**\n\nReturn to the daily data and use ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Start of the\nRains***, see Fig. 7.2f.\n\nThe dialogue is shown in Fig. 7.3a. If it is not automatically completed\nas in Fig. 7.2i, then either you did not define the data as climatic\n(Fig. 7.2e), or you are on the wrong data frame.\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| ***Fig. 7.3a Start of the rains dialogue***                           |\n|                                                                       |\n| ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Start of the Rains***                       |\n+=======================================================================+\n| ![](figures/Fig7.3a.png){width=\"5.065784120734908in\"                   |\n| height=\"4.630577427821522in\"}                                         |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nThis is the first \"tailored\" product, i.e. there is no fixed definition.\nWhat is needed is a definition that corresponds as closely as possible\nto something used by farmers -- perhaps for a specified crop.\n\nThe first decision is the earliest possible planting date. If there were\nrain in Moorings on 1^st^ October it would almost certainly be ignored,\nbecause it would probably be followed by a long dry spell.\n\nAs an example, we suggest 15^th^ November as the earliest date. Then\nalso 15^th^ January as the latest date, i.e. after then it would not be\nworth planting.\n\nIn Fig. 7.3a, press the Day Range button and complete the sub-dialogue\nas shown in Fig. 7.3b.\n\nAfter returning to Fig. 7.3a change the ***2 days to 3 days*** and\nchoose to also ***save the Date*** column. Then press ***Ok***. The full\ndefinition is then:\n\n***Event 1:*** \"The first occasion from 15^th^ November with more than\n20mm within a 3-day period.\"\n\nThe resulting data are in Fig. 7.3c. The Start of the rains dialogue has\nadded 2 more columns to the yearly data frame, one giving the day number\n(from 1 August) and the other giving the date. In the 1922/23 season the\nday was 119 or 27 November, while it was also in late November for the\nfollowing two seasons.\n\nThe start_doy column is used in the further analysis. The start_date\ncolumn is just to assist interpretation.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.3b***                                        ***Fig. 7.3c***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.3b.png){width=\"3.0814129483814523in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.3c.png){width=\"3.0145188101487315in\"\n  height=\"2.829251968503937in\"}                          height=\"3.4613035870516184in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith the start date, or even with the totals from Section 7.2, you could\nproceed straight to a PICSA-type graph.\n\nUse ***Climatic \\> PICSA \\> Rainfall Graph***. Include the\n***start_doy*** variable, and then the ***PICSA options*** Fig. 7.3d.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.3d***                                        ***Fig. 7.3e Sub-dialogue***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.3d.png){width=\"3.0023589238845143in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.3e.png){width=\"3.0185444006999127in\"\n  height=\"2.9970253718285216in\"}                         height=\"2.2601170166229223in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe sub-dialogue in Fig. 7.3e is used to display the ***Y-axis*** as\ndates, rather than day numbers. Use also the ***Lines*** tab to add a\nline for the mean, and possibly also the ***X-Axis*** to untick the\nangle for the labels. The resulting graph is in Fig. 7.3f.\n\nThe graph shows the mean starting day was 28^th^ November. There was\njust one year with a starting date in January. There were also 10 years\nwhere the starting date was on the lower limit of 15^th^ November.\nPerhaps the earliest date should have been even earlier?\n\nAs a small investigation, change the names of the two columns\n(***right-click, Rename***). Then use the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\>\nStart of the Rains*** dialogue again, changing the earliest start date\nto 1^st^ November[^36]. The definition is now:\n\n***Event 2:*** \"The first occasion from 1^st^ November with more than\n20mm within a 3-day period.\"\n\nThen the PICSA rainfall graph is run again (unaltered) giving the graph\nin Fig. 7.3g. The mean is now 9 days earlier.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.3f Start of the rains from 15 November***   ***Fig. 7.3g Start from 1^st^ November***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.3f.png){width=\"2.985117016622922in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.3g.png){width=\"3.0534448818897637in\"\n  height=\"2.325653980752406in\"}                         height=\"2.330170603674541in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are other components of the Start of the Rains dialogue that can\noptionally be used. For example, in India a definition (for the Summer\nmonsoon) is of the form:\n\n***Event 3:*** First occasion from 1 June with more than 25mm in 5 days,\nor which at least 3 days are rainy.\n\nThis uses the Number of Rainy Days checkbox in Fig. 7.3a.\n\nThe third checkbox in Fig. 7.3a is called Dry Spell. Events 1 and 2 can\nbe considered as defining planting opportunities, while if a dry spell\ncondition is added, this might define a successful planting.\n\n***Rename*** the last columns that were produced -- so they are not\noverwritten.\n\nThen return to the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Start of the Rains***\ndialogue and check the ***Dry Spells*** checkbox, Fig. 7.3h. The\ndefinition is now:\n\n***Event 4:*** First occasion from 1^st^ November with more than 20mm in\n3 days, and no dry spell of more than 9-days in the next 3 weeks (21\ndays).\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.3h***                                        ***Fig. 7.3i***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.3h.png){width=\"2.9236253280839897in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.3i.png){width=\"3.1584995625546806in\"\n  height=\"1.2810498687664043in\"}                         height=\"3.1205599300087488in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe data resulting from Events 1, 2 and 4 are shown in Fig. 7.3i. They\nshow that in 1965, with Event 2, there was a planting opportunity on 13\nNovember, but that was not successful. The date of the successful\nplanting was 20^th^ December.\n\nThere was just one year, namely 1972, where there was no successful\nplanting by the imposed limit of 15 January.\n\nEvent 2 and Event 4 can be compared. Use ***Prepare \\> Column: Calculate\n\\> Calculations*** and subtract the date of Event 2 from Event 4, Fig.\n7.3j.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.3j Difference from including a dry spell***                                        ***Fig. 7.3k Exceedance graph for 3 definitions***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.3j.png){width=\"2.807392825896763in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.3k.png){width=\"3.2067639982502185in\"\n  height=\"3.2033048993875766in\"}                         height=\"3.2067639982502185in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe results are also shown in the last column in Fig. 7.3i. Where the\nvalue in this last column is zero the first planting was successful.\nOtherwise the value shows the delay, before the date of the successful\nstart. Looking down this column, or ***filtering***, or using ***Prepare\n\\> Column: Reshape \\> Column Summaries*** shows there were 22 non-zero\nvalues, a risk of 1 year in 4.\n\nIf this risk is too high, then one way to reduce it, might be to omit\nthe early planting dates and start later. Changing Event4 to start on\n15^th^ November, and comparing those results with Event 1, changes the\nrisk to 12 years or about 14%.\n\nConservation farming is encouraged in Southern Zambia and one component\nis water conservation, using planting in small hollows. The promoters\nestimate this gives an extra 3 days, that seedlings could withstand\ndrought. So, keeping to 1 November in Event 4, and changing the 9 days\nto 12 days could also be considered. This halves the risk, as there are\nthen just 10 years when replanting was needed.\n\nThe data may also be plotted as exceedance graphs, as is shown in Fig.\n7.3k for the Events 1, 2 and 4.\n\n## The end and length\n\nA common definition for the end of the rainy season is based on a simple\nwater balance model. This has been adequate in the unimodal stations in\nWest Africa, but has problems with stations, like Moorings in the\nSouthern hemisphere.\n\nHence, we first look quickly at a site in Northern Nigeria, before\nreturning to discuss the end and length of the season at Moorings.\n\nUse ***File \\> Open from Library \\> Instat \\> Browse \\> Climatic \\>\nNigeria*** and open the file called ***Samaru.rds***. The data frame\ncalled Samaru56t has 56 years of daily data from 1928, Fig. 7.4a.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.4a Samaru daily data***                                        ***Fig. 7.4b Start of rains for Samaru***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.4a.png){width=\"2.9693438320209973in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.4b.png){width=\"2.98371719160105in\"\n  height=\"3.036609798775153in\"}                         height=\"2.003601268591426in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis data frame is already defined as climatic, so proceed directly to\nthe ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Start of the Rains*** dialogue.\n\nThese data are from January. In this dialogue, set the earliest date as\n***1st April*** and the latest as ***30 June***. Use ***Event 5*** as\nshown in Fig. 7.4b:\n\n***Event 5***: First occasion from ***1st April*** with more than\n***20mm in 3 days*** and no dry spell longer than ***9 days*** in the\nnext ***21 days***.\n\nAs in the previous section, get the starting day of year and the\ncorresponding date.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.4c End of rains/Season dialogue***                                        ***Fig. 7.4d The season length***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.4c.png){width=\"2.7529779090113737in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.4d.png){width=\"3.010003280839895in\"\n  height=\"3.6972845581802276in\"}                         height=\"2.409067147856518in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow use ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> End of the Rains*** and complete the\ndialogue as shown in Fig. 7.4c\n\nThe water balance \"model\" is like a simple \"bucket\". It is empty in the\ndry season. It is then filled by the rainfall and loses a constant\namount of 5mm per day, due to evaporation. The capacity of the bucket,\nin Fig. 7.4c, is 100mm. Any excess, when the bucket is full, is assumed\nlost to runoff.\n\nIn the middle of the season (August), the bucket is usually quite full.\nThe end of the season is defined, in Fig. 7.4c, as the first time, after\n15^th^ August, that the bucket is effectively empty.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.4e Samaru summary data***                                        ***Fig. 7.4f Time-series graphs***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.4e.png){width=\"2.875333552055993in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.4f.png){width=\"3.27461176727909in\"\n  height=\"2.702120516185477in\"}                         height=\"2.7685083114610674in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe length of the season is then, from ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\>\nLength,*** simply the difference between the end and the start dates,\nFig. 7.4d.\n\nThe resulting annual data are shown in Fig. 7.4e. Various graphs are\npossible. The time series graph in Fig. 7.4f indicates clearly the\nsmaller inter-annual variability of the end of the season, compared to\nthe start. This graph was produced using ***Describe \\> Specific \\> Line\nPlot***. An alternative would have been the ***Climatic \\> PICSA \\>\nRainfall Graph***.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.4g Exceedance plots***                                        ***Fig. 7.4h Length of the season at Samaru***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.4g.png){width=\"2.5142836832895887in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.4h.png){width=\"3.2541535433070865in\"\n  height=\"3.160087489063867in\"}                         height=\"3.2136154855643047in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn alternative display is with exceedance graphs, Fig. 7.4g. Here the\ngreater steepness of the line for the end of the season, corresponds to\nthe lower variability. The ***Prepare \\> Column: Calculate \\>\nCalculations*** can be used to show the standard deviation of the start\nis about 17 days (over 2 weeks), while it is about 9 days (just over 1\nweek) for the end of the season.\n\nFig. 7.4h shows the length of the season, using the ***Climatic \\> PICSA\n\\> Rainfall Graphs*** dialogue. Terciles have been added to show that\nabout 1/3 of the years had a season length of less than 152 days, i.e. 5\nmonths, and 1/3 had more than 172 days -- almost 6 months.\n\nNow return to the Moorings data in the Southern hemisphere[^37]. The\nstart was considered in Section 7.3 and we choose the definition 4, i.e.\nfrom 1 November, but with no dry spell of more than 12 days. In\nprinciple it simply remains to get the end of the season, and then the\nlength, as above.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.4i End of the season dialogue***                                        ***Fig. 7.4j***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.4i.png){width=\"2.5004582239720037in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.4j.png){width=\"3.6275896762904636in\"\n  height=\"2.9221620734908136in\"}                         height=\"2.6182830271216098in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo illustrate the problem first try the same analysis as for Samaru,\nFig. 7.4i. Make the day range 15^th^ February to 15^th^ June, as the\nequivalent of 15^th^ August to 15^th^ December for Samaru. The results\nare in Fig. 7.4j and a few of the problems are highlighted.\n\nIn some years the season appears to end in February, and sometimes on\nthe precise day (15^th^ February) that is the lower limit. This never\nhappened at Samaru as the water balance was always full (or close to\nfull) throughout August. So, August, in the Sahel, has reliable rain.\nThis isn't the case at Moorings, where there can be a long dry spell at\nany time in the season.\n\nWe would still prefer to consider issues in February as a problem during\nthe season -- which is covered in Section 7.6, - rather than necessarily\na very early end of the season.\n\nIn an analysis of 5 stations in Zimbabwe, (Mupamgwa, Walker, & Twomlow,\n2011) proposed a different type of definition for the end of the season.\nThis was the ***last day with more than 10mm*** between 1 January and 30\nJune. This type of definition has been added to the ***Climatic \\>\nPrepare \\> End of the Rains*** dialogue, Fig. 7.4k.\n\nFor Moorings we have used the last day with more than 10mm up to the end\nof April, Fig. 4.7k.\n\nIn using this definition some meteorology staff complained that this was\nclearly the end of the rains and they would prefer the end of the\nseason.\n\nWhat is therefore also available in R-Instat is to use the above\ndefinition for the end of the rains and then to start the water-balance\ndefinition from that date -- which is a different date each year. Return\nto ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> End of Rains***, select the ***End of\nSeason*** and then the ***Day Range*** again, Fig. 7.4l.\n\nIn Fig. 7.4l choose ***Variable Day*** and select the ***end_rains***\nvariable from the summary data. Keep the end date as ***Fixed Day***,\nand choose 30 June.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.4k***                                        ***Fig. 7.4l Day Range on End of Rains***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.4k.png){width=\"2.8328587051618546in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.4l.png){width=\"3.160076552930884in\"\n  height=\"3.822027559055118in\"}                         height=\"2.9263724846894137in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReturn to the main dialogue, Fig. 7.4m and set as shown. The results are\nshown in Fig. 7.4n and are more reasonable.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.4m***                                       ***Fig. 7.4n***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.4m.png){width=\"2.603765310586177in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.4n.png){width=\"3.490068897637795in\"\n  height=\"2.949931102362205in\"}                         height=\"2.434850174978128in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow use ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Length of Season***, as shown for\nSamaru in Fig. 7.4d, to give the length.\n\nThe start and end of the season are plotted in Fig. 7.4o. Unlike Samaru,\nthey are approximately equally variable, and each has a standard\ndeviation of just over 2 weeks. The cumulative frequency graph\nillustrates the same point, with each of the start, end_rains and\nend_season having roughly equal slopes and with each having a range of\nabout 2 months (i.e. roughly 4 times the standard deviation).\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.4o***                                        ***Fig. 7.4p***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.4o.png){width=\"3.1805818022747157in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.4p.png){width=\"2.9403291776027998in\"\n  height=\"3.0530741469816274in\"}                         height=\"3.0423261154855643in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFig. 7.4q plots the season lengths. Here about 1/3 have a length less\nthan 4 months, while the longest third has a duration of five months or\nmore.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.4q***\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.4q.png){width=\"5.721399825021872in\"\n  height=\"4.006120953630796in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Coping with censored and missing data\n\nCensoring occurs in many areas of application of statistics. The topic\nis particularly important in the analysis of medical data. There the\nsurvival times of patients may be recorded for a study up to 3 years.\nThose who survive longer are the censored observations. We know the\nsurvival is more than 3 years, but don't know exactly how long.\n\nIn hydrology the height of a river may be measured. At times of flooding\nthe height may be more than the measuring instrument, but the exact\nvalue isn't known.\n\nIn climatology a heavy wind may destroy the measuring equipment. In that\ncase the exact censoring point is unknown, but we do know that a large\nvalue occurred.\n\nThere is also possible censoring with the start and end of the season in\nSections 7.3 and 7.4.\n\nTo illustrate, use the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Start of the Rains***\ndialogue again, Fig. 7.5a. This time we deliberately choose a small\nplanting window, Fig. 7.5b. The latest planting date is designed to be\nthe date beyond which a farmer would not think it would be sensible to\nplant for that season. That is not likely to be 30 November, but we\nchoose that early date to illustrate the issue of censoring.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.5a***                                        ***Fig. 7.5b***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.5a.png){width=\"3.6063549868766405in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.5b.png){width=\"2.412521872265967in\"\n  height=\"3.5927974628171477in\"}                         height=\"1.9594477252843394in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Fig. 7.5a the variable names for the results are also changed, to\navoid overwriting the previous variables. The results are in Fig. 7.5c,\ntogether with the previous ones. In the 1925/26 season the earliest\nplanting opportunity was 3^rd^ January. This is now too late and hence\nis now given as a missing value. The same is done in the following\nseason when the earliest date was 8^th^ December.\n\nIn the subsequent analysis we should examine the number of occasions\nthat planting was not possible. One way is to use the ***Climatic \\>\nTidy and Examine \\> One Variable Summarise*** dialogue, Fig. 7.5d.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.5c***                                        ***Fig. 7.5d***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.5c.png){width=\"3.2000076552930885in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.5d.png){width=\"2.7899529746281715in\"\n  height=\"3.4125951443569553in\"}                         height=\"2.5082305336832897in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe results, in Fig. 7.5e, indicates there were 17 seasons in which the\nnew starting date was censored. However, the problem is that there was\nalready one season for which the original definition was missing. That\nwas not due to censoring, but because there were also missing values in\nthe first season.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.5e***                                      ***Fig. 7.5f***\n  ---------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.5e.png){width=\"3.32001968503937in\"   \n  height=\"1.4180129046369203in\"}                       \n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, there were, 16 years when no planting was possible in November. That\nis interesting information itself. But the main problem is that the\nsummaries are missing for 2 different reasons, namely either because\nthere were days with missing data, or because planting was not possible,\ni.e. there was censoring.\n\nTo proceed we fist explain how R-Instat handles missing values, i.e.\ndays when the rainfall was not recorded. There are various options when\nproducing (say) monthly summaries that were discussed earlier. But what\nhappens with the start and end of the rains.\n\nFor the start of the rains the summary is set to missing if any day is\nmissing in the period calculated. For example in Fig. 7.5c the start in\n1922/23 was on 27^th^ November.\n\n-   Had any value been missing between 1^st^ and 27^th^ November 1922,\n    then the result would have been set to missing.\n\n-   If there were a missing day on 1^st^ December 1922 the result would\n    be given, i.e. it would not be set to missing, because the rains had\n    already started.\n\n-   One detail is that the result would also be set to missing if either\n    30^th^ or 31^st^ October 1922 were missing, because then the 3-day\n    total on 1^st^ November cannot be calculated.\n\nThe same idea is true for the end of the rains, i.e. if a missing value\nis encountered in the period when it calculates the end of the rains,\nthen the result is set to missing. Otherwise it is given.\n\nFor the Moorings data there is only one missing day in the record, once\nit has started in early 1922. This was on 10^th^ March 2004. The end of\nthe rains was defined to be last occasion with more than 10mm between 1\nJanuary and 30 June. This missing value is within the period, but the\ncalculation has \"worked backwards\" and found the last day on 23^rd^\nMarch 2004. The missing value did not affect this calculation and hence\nthe value is given.\n\nThe calculation is more complicated for the water balance definition. If\nthere are missing water-balance values in the period of calculation,\nthen the summary is set to missing. If the rainfall is ever missing,\nthen the water balance is set to missing. Once the rainfall is no longer\nmissing the water balance may still be missing, because it does not know\nwhat the state was, just after the rainfall data resumed. Hence, the\nanalysis is doubled, starting with both a full and an empty balance\n(i.e. the two extremes). While these are different, the water balance is\nstill set to missing. Once they are the same, the water balance\ncalculation resumes.\n\nThese decisions on missing values are strict and some users may feel\nthat a single missing day should not set the summary for that year, or\nseason, to be missing. In that case consider infilling the data,\ndiscussed in chapter [xxx]{.mark}.\n\nWe now return to the censoring problem. Return to the ***Climatic \\>\nPrepare \\> Start of the Rains*** dialogue in Fig. 7.5a and tick the\nthird option for saving columns, called ***Occurrence***. This adds a\nlogical column to the summaries that can be used to distinguish between\nmissing and censored seasons.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig.7.5g***                      ***Fig. 7.5h***\n  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------\n                                      \n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[To be continued once status variable sorted.]{.mark}\n\n## During the season\n\nThis section considers examples of risks during the rainy season.\n\nChapter 6 examined rainfall totals and rain days throughout the year.\nNow they are examined for the season.\n\nThe simplest is to consider fixed periods. At Moorings the rainy season\nis from November to April. Use ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Climatic\nSummaries***, as shown in Fig. 7.6a.\n\nIn Fig. 7.6a press ***Summaries*** and choose just the ***N\nnon-missing*** and the ***Sum***. Click on ***Day Range*** and choose\n***1 November to 30 April***.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.6a Summaries for Moorings***                                        ***Fig. 7.6b Rename the resulting columns***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.6a.png){width=\"2.830631014873141in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.6b.png){width=\"3.1565660542432195in\"\n  height=\"3.031419510061242in\"}                         height=\"2.169508967629046in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce run, change the ***rain*** variable in Fig. 7.6a, to\n***raindays,*** and this time just get the ***Sum***. You may have found\nthat the variables overwrote the ones produced earlier for the full\nyear. To ensure this does not happen in the future, rename the 3\ncolumns, Fig. 7.6b. It is also useful to add an explanatory label as\nshown in Fig. 7.6b.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.6c Day Range sub-dialogue***                                        ***Fig. 7.6d Main climatic summaries dialogue***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.6c.png){width=\"2.8821183289588803in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.6d.png){width=\"2.9964971566054244in\"\n  height=\"2.308405511811024in\"}                         height=\"2.283847331583552in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe totals can also be calculated for the rainy season each year. Return\nto the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Climatic Summaries*** dialogue. Use the\n***rain*** variable and then press ***Day Range***. Complete as shown in\nFig. 7.6c, where the total is now from the ***start doy*** to the\n***end-season***. This is confirmed on the ***return*** to the main\ndialogue, Fig. 7.6d.\n\nIn Fig. 7.6d click on Summaries and choose the Count Non Missing and the\nSum. Once produced, ***right-click*** and ***rename*** the Sum variable\nas ***rainSeason***. The ***Count Non Missing*** column is now the\nseason length. This is another way to get the length!\n\nA third possibility is to produce the total (or the number of rain days)\nfor a fixed period following the start. Return once more to the\n***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Climatic Summaries*** and change the ***Day\nRange*** as indicated in Fig. 7.6e, i.e. for ***120 days from the\nstart***.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.6e***                                        ***Fig. 7.6f***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.6e.png){width=\"3.0676574803149608in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.6f.png){width=\"2.9292443132108485in\"\n  height=\"2.317785433070866in\"}                          height=\"2.886791338582677in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis would be for a 120-day crop. The approximate water requirement of\nmany crops is known, so the results are the first step in calculating\nthe risks of not having enough water for a specified (20 day) crop in\nthe period following planting.\n\nThe summary columns produced are shown in Fig. 7.6f.\n\nThe results are presented as exceedance probabilities in Fig. 7.6g and\nas time series in Fig. 7.6h.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.6g Exceedance graphs of rainfall totals***  ***Fig. 7.6h Time-series graphs***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.6g.png){width=\"2.965719597550306in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.6h.png){width=\"2.9133048993875765in\"\n  height=\"2.869301181102362in\"}                         height=\"2.893001968503937in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe three totals are sufficiently similar that plotting the 3 lines on a\nsingle time-series graph in Fig. 7.6h would be confusing, so they are\nplotted as facets[^38]....\n\nThe same ideas are now considered for spell lengths. In the tropics,\ndrought is a problem and hence we consider the occurrence of long dry\nspells. The same dialogue could equally be used for hot, or cold, spells\nin temperature data, etc.\n\nThe simplest is to find the longest spell length within the main months\nof the rainy season. Continuing with the Moorings data, use ***Climatic\n\\> Prepare \\> Spells***, Fig. 7.6i.\n\nUse the Day Range sub-dialogue to specify ***January 1 to March 31*** as\nthe range of days. The results, shown in Fig. 7.6j give the longest\ndry-spell length within this 3-month period. It shows the longest number\nof consecutive days with rain less than 0.85mm on any day.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.6i Spells dialogue***  ***Fig. 7.6j Spell lengths Jan-Mar & Apr***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.6i.png){width=\"3.3136023622047244in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.6j.png){width=\"2.8059109798775155in\"\n  height=\"3.7084175415573055in\"}                         height=\"3.2692727471566054in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo clarify the results, use ***Climatic \\> Check Data \\> Display\nDaily***[^39]. Data for 4 early years are in Fig. 7.6k to be compared\nwith the results in Fig. 7.6j.\n\nIn Fig. 7.6j the longest spell in 1924 is 19 days. Fig. 7.6k shows that\nthis is a spell from 13^th^ February to 2^nd^ March. In 1925 the longest\nspell was just 6 days and was at the end of March. This included days\nwith small rainfalls, but each was lower than the 0.85mm threshold.\n\nThe 7-day spell in 1926 was also at the end of March. In 1927 there was\nalso a long dry spell (14 days) at the end of March, and this also shows\nthat just the longest spell is given. That year also had 13 consecutive\ndry days in January. If more detail is needed, then the three months\ncould be considered individually.\n\nIt sometimes causes confusion that the longest spell in a month can be\nlonger than the month itself. We illustrate by calculating the longest\nspell length in April. The results are also given in the last column in\nFig. 7.6j. They show that the longest dry spell in April 2024 was 43\ndays. This is confirmed from Fig. 7.6k, because 1^st^ April 2024\n\"inherited\" a dry spell from March, of 13 days, i.e. from 19^th^ March.\nSo, 1^st^ April was already the 14^th^ consecutive dry day and this had\nbecome 43 days by the ned of April. There is an option in the dialogue\nif you only wish to consider April itself. This option is used in\nSection 7.7.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.6k Data for January to April for 4 years***\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.6k.png){width=\"5.985853018372703in\"\n  height=\"3.079802055993001in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs with the rainfall totals, it is sometimes useful to find the longest\ndry spell in the rainy season, (i.e. between the day of the start and\nthe end) or in part of the season. As with the rainfall totals this uses\nthe start and end dates each year. In the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\>\nSpells*** dialogue, change the day range as was shown for the rainfall\ntotals in Fig. 7.6c and Fig. 7.6e.\n\nFig. 7.6l shows the results for the season, i.e. between the date of the\nstart of the rains and the end of the season. The median value for the\nlongest spell length is 14 days (2 weeks). The terciles are also given,\nshowing that one year in 3 has a longest spell length of 12 days or\nless. But also a third of the years has a spell length of 18 days or\nmore.\n\nFig. 7.6m shows the longest spell lengths for the 120 days following\nplanting. The results are similar, but without the longest spells shown\nin Fig. 7.6l.\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.6l Longest dry-spell in the season***      ***Fig. 7.6m Longest spell in the first 120 days***\n  ---------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.6l.png){width=\"3.01744750656168in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.6m.png){width=\"3.041823053368329in\"\n  height=\"3.0595516185476814in\"}                       height=\"3.041823053368329in\"}\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMany crops are particularly sensitive to dry spells during the flowering\nperiod. This is typically about 20 days (3 weeks). Suppose a crop that\nreaches the start of flowering 50 days after planting. Calculating the\nrisk is currently a 2-stage process in R-Instat. First produce the new\ncolumn, for the start of flowering, Fig. 7.6n. This is an instance where\nyou can also transform the start_date as is shown in Fig. 7.6o.\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.6n Calculate the start of floweing***      ***Fig. 7.6o***\n  ---------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.6n.png){width=\"2.945898950131234in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.6o.png){width=\"2.898616579177603in\"\n  height=\"3.30875656167979in\"}                       height=\"3.2563954505686787in\"}\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resulting data are in Fig. 7.6p. The ***flower_date*** variable\nshows that the flowering period often starts late in December or in\nearly January, but it is occasionally also in February.\n\nThe ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Spells*** dialogue is now used from the\n***start_flower*** day for ***20 days***. The resulting variable is also\nshown in Fig. 7.6p and is seen often to be quite short. For example, the\nlongest spell from early 2024 for the next few years is usually just 2\nor 3 consecutive dry days.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.6p***                                        ***Fig. 7.6q***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.6p.png){width=\"2.9749759405074365in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.6q.png){width=\"2.927165354330709in\"\n  height=\"2.5203543307086615in\"}                         height=\"2.893520341207349in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe results are plotted in Fig. 7.6q using ***Climatic \\> PICSA \\>\nRainfall Graph*** again. Only in 1/3 of the years is there a dry spell\nof one week or more. However, in 13 of the 77 years, i.e. one year in\nsix, there was a dry spell of 10 days or more.\n\nThe graph in Fig. 7.6q is from a variable date. In a particular year,\nonce you know the planting date, or also from crops that are photoperiod\nsensitive, the dates are fixed. Once calculated, if the risk is high,\nthen perhaps remedial action can be taken, such as planning for some\nirrigated water to be available for this period.\n\nA third aspect that can cause a problem during the season is a climatic\nextreme. This may be drought, as considered in the dry spells above. It\ncould also be an extreme wind, or excessive rainfall causing flooding.\nExtremes are considered in detail in Chapter 11, hence only a single\nexample is given here.\n\nA question posed in relation to rainfall in Niger, was the risk of more\nthan 100m rain within a 3-day period. The argument was that while a\nsingle day with more than 100mm would be a problem, so would, say 40mm,\non each of 3 days.\n\nThree day running totals were already used \"behind the scenes\" in\ncalculating the start of the rains. Now these totals are needed\nexplicitly. Use ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Transform***, as shown in Fig.\n7.6r.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.6r Transform dialogue***                                        ***Fig. 7.6s Resulting data totaled 3 days***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.6r.png){width=\"2.765544619422572in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.6s.png){width=\"3.288202099737533in\"\n  height=\"3.6314173228346456in\"}                         height=\"3.0874376640419947in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resulting daily data, in Fig. 7.6s, show an instance in February\n1923 where the total is more than 100mm.\n\nNow the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Climatic Summaries*** dialogue may be\nused again, as shown in Fig. 7.6t. The summaries are from ***January to\nMarch*** and the only summary is the ***Maximum***, Fig. 7.6u.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.6t***                                      ***Fig. 7.6u Just get the maximum***\n  ---------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.6t.png){width=\"2.90619750656168in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.6u.png){width=\"2.5900973315835523in\"\n  height=\"3.158471128608924in\"}                        height=\"2.9131627296587927in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resulting summary data can now be plotted as shown in Fig. 7.6v and\nFig. 7.6w. From Fig. 7.6w there is 100mm or more in about 4 years in 10.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.6v Time series of 3-day extremes***          ***Fig. 7.6w Cumulative distribution***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.6v.png){width=\"3.2525470253718285in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.6w.png){width=\"2.5978171478565177in\"\n  height=\"3.2487839020122484in\"}                         height=\"3.46375656167979in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## It rained yesterday. Should I plant?\n\nFor Moorings, in Zambia, the definition for the start of the rains was\nthe first occasion from 1 November with more than 20mm in 3 days.\n\nFor successful planting the condition was added that there should not be\na dry spell of more than 9 (consecutive) dry days in the next 21 days.\nIn Section 7.3 the two columns (with and without the dry-spell\ncondition) were compared, showing that replanting would be needed in 1\nyear in 4.\n\nThat is an overall risk, because sometimes a planting opportunity was\nearly and in other years there was no opportunity until December. If the\ndata are examined more closely, they show that planting was possible by\n6^th^ November in 14 of the years. However, replanting was needed (i.e.\nthe dry spell condition wasn't satisfied) in 7 of these years. That is a\nrisk of 1 year in 2 when very early planting was possible. Perhaps 1^st^\nNovember is too early to consider planting, unless you are willing to\nentertain the high risk.\n\nThis question can be turned around. Suppose, in a particular year, there\nis a potential planting date on 7^th^ November. What is the risk from\nplanting then?\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.7a Dry spell risk after planting***          ***Fig. 7.7b Result from 8 Nov and 8 Dec***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.7a.png){width=\"2.881582458442695in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.7b.png){width=\"2.830893482064742in\"\n  height=\"3.3937401574803148in\"}                        height=\"3.4122856517935256in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Fig. 7.7a the ***Day Range*** is from 8 November for 21 days. Another\nchange is that 7^th^ November is assumed to be rainy, i.e. not in a dry\nspell. So, the ***checkbox \"Assume condition not satisfied at the\nstart\"*** is ticked.\n\nThe results, in Fig. 7.7b indicate that planting early is quite risky.\nFour years have a dry spell of 10 days or more, even in the few years\nshown in Fig. 7.7b. If you change the dates in Fig. 7.7a by a month,\nthen the same analysis shows just a single year now gives a problem.\nInterestingly that year was not a problem with the early planting.\n\nSummarising the two columns[^40] shows 32 years, about 1 year in 3, had\na dry spell of more than 9 days with the early planting, compared with\njust 11 years, or 1 year in 8, from the later planting date\n\nWhat we lose on risk from early planting, we potentially gain by having\na longer season length. In Section 7.4 the season length was\n\n***Length = end_season -- start_doy.***\n\nThe results were shown in Fig. 7.4q and showed that about 1/3 of the\nyears had a season length of less than 4 months, etc. This figure is\nrepeated as Fig. 7.7c\n\nNow that we know the start is on day 100 (8^th^ November) and hence the\nlength is, instead, found from:\n\n***Length =*** ***end_season -- 100***\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.7c***                                        ***Fig. 7.7d***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.7c.png){width=\"3.1445713035870515in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.7d.png){width=\"2.862133639545057in\"\n  height=\"2.201829615048119in\"}                          height=\"2.2399857830271217in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComparing the information in Fig. 7.7c and 7.7d shows that with early\nplanting, on day 100, there are virtually no years with a season length\nof less than 4 months. This is compared to 1/3 of the years overall\n(Fig. 7.7c). The variability is also considerably reduced, because the\nstart is now fixed. The variability is now only because of the\nuncertainty of the end.\n\nWith this early planting we could therefore perhaps plan for 120-day\ncrop. That would have almost no risk in terms of season length. If the\nproposed crop needs (say) 600mm of water, we could now find the\nproportion of years with at least that total. That uses the ***Climatic\n\\> Prepare \\> Climatic Summaries*** dialogue, as shown in Fig. 7.7e.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.7e***                      ***Fig. 7.7f***                  \n  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.7e.png){width=\"2.2509109798775153in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.7f.png){width=\"3.585155293088364in\"\n  height=\"2.7010925196850395in\"}                         height=\"2.7200470253718287in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resulting totals can then be examined in various ways. The\ntime-series graph, Fig. 7.7f, is one option. This indicates quite a high\nrisk of less than 600mm. A crop needing only 500mm would have a much\nlower risk. There are only a few years with much less than 500mm.\n\nAn alternative, with this early planting, could be to aim for a\nshort-duration cereal crop, e.g. 90 days and then to try for a\nshort-season legume, that might be planted as the cereal is close to\nmaturity. Fig. 7.7d indicates that this would often have had enough time\nfor fodder, and occasionally would have long enough to mature.\n\n## Reduce risks\n\nIn the previous section risks were calculated relative to a proposed\nplanting date. In this section we examine the seasonal pattern of the\nrisks. This enables a study of the following types of problem.\n\n-   For Moorings the risk of replanting was about one year in three if\n    planting on 8^th^ November. (Assuming replanting is needed if there\n    is a dry spell of 10 days or longer in the following 21 days.) How\n    does this risk depend on the date of planting? Does the risk ever\n    approach zero?\n\n-   For the option of a 120-day crop that needs (say) at least 600mm of\n    water, when would be the best days to plant?\n\nThe method is similar for these two -- and for other similar problems.\nFor simplicity the 120-day total is considered first. There is no\nspecial dialogue, so the analysis proceeds step-by-step.\n\nFirst use the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Transform*** dialogue as shown\nin Fig. 7.8a. This transforms the rainfall data into 120-day moving\ntotals. The resulting data are shown in Fig. 7.8b after reordering the\ncolumns. They show that in the 1922/23 season there was more than 600mm\nif planting was before 11^th^ January.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8a***                                        ***Fig. 7.8b***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8a.png){width=\"2.8864490376202974in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8b.png){width=\"2.631972878390201in\"\n  height=\"3.535900043744532in\"}                          height=\"3.3305041557305337in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThese data re now summarised over the years, this time to get a value\nfor each day of the year. This uses the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\>\nClimatic Summaries*** dialogue, Fig. 7.8c. Use the ***Within Year***\noption in Fig. 7.8c and complete the dialogue as shown.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8c***                                       ***Fig. 7.8d***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8c.png){width=\"3.071239063867017in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8d.png){width=\"2.854338363954506in\"\n  height=\"3.2887182852143484in\"}                        height=\"2.9252132545931757in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the Climatic Summaries sub-dialogue use the ***More*** tab as shown\nin Fig. 7.8d.\n\nThis produces a new data frame shown in Fig. 7.8e.\n\nRepeat the dialogue in Fig. 7.8c, changing the 600mm to 450mm\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8e***                                        ***Fig. 7.8f***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8e.png){width=\"2.3958114610673666in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8f.png){width=\"3.147263779527559in\"\n  height=\"3.309788932633421in\"}                          height=\"3.328632983377078in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt now just remains to graph the results. This uses the ***Describe \\>\nSpecific \\> Line Plot*** dialogue, Fig. 7.8f. The results are in Fig.\n7.8g[^41].\n\nIn Fig 7.8g the higher (red) line is for 600mm. It shows the minimum\nrisk corresponds to a planting on about 15^th^ November and is then\nabout 0.3 (30%). The lower line, for 450mm, is below 1 year in 10, for\nplantings from 1 November to about 10 December.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig.7.8g***                                         ***Fig. 7.8h***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8g.png){width=\"3.5475896762904635in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8h.png){width=\"2.5728630796150482in\"\n  height=\"3.200142169728784in\"}                          height=\"3.1953313648293964in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne improvement in the presentation would be to smooth the lines given\nin Fig. 7.8g. They are quite smooth already, as there were 88 years of\ndata. With shorter records the need for smoothing becomes greater.\n\nMoving averages are the simplest way of smoothing. Use ***Climatic \\>\nPrepare \\> Transform*** as shown in Fig. 7.8h. This adds the 2 smoothed\ncolumns to the data frame.\n\nNote also that the risks are (of course) very high from March onwards.\nHence filter the data on the day of year. The 1^st^ March is s_doy =\n214.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8i***                                       ***Fig. 7.8j***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8i.png){width=\"2.931535433070866in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8j.png){width=\"2.9926859142607176in\"\n  height=\"2.9797069116360455in\"}                        height=\"3.023222878390201in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFig. 7.8i shows plots of the data together with the smoothed lines. R\nand hence R-Instat has many other methods of smoothing data. One\nalternative method is shown below in Fig. 7.8q.\n\nThe same ideas can be used to examine the risks of a long dry spell at\ndifferent points in the season. We first consider the risk of a dry\nspell after a planting occasion, i.e. after a rain day. This uses the\nspecial ***Multiple Spells*** tab in the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\>\nTransform*** dialogue. In Fig. 7.8j the maximum spell length is taken\nover 21 days, and that can, of course, be changed as required.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8k***                                       ***Fig. 7.8l***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8k.png){width=\"3.018669072615923in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8l.png){width=\"2.9690758967629045in\"\n  height=\"2.3882228783902013in\"}                        height=\"1.9140452755905513in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next step, as before, uses the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Climatic\nSummaries*** dialogue, Fig.7.8k to calculate the proportion of years\nwith a dry-spell ***longer than 9 days*** in the 21 days, following\nplanting, i.e. to correspond to the default values in the ***Start of\nthe Rains*** dialogue.\n\nOnce calculated, repeat the operation with 7 days (for a more sensitive\ncrop) and 12 days, perhaps to correspond to the extra days following a\nconservation farming strategy.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8m***                                        ***Fig. 7.8n***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8m.png){width=\"2.5843143044619423in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8n.png){width=\"3.183617672790901in\"\n  height=\"3.321859142607174in\"}                          height=\"3.687192694663167in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe data are shown in Fig. 7.8m where, for variety, we have used\npercentages rather than proportions.\n\nThe dry-spell risks are shown in Fig. 7.8n. They show that, in early\nNovember, it is quite advantageous, in terms of risk, to have the\n12-days, rather than the 9 days assurance for the dry spells. By early\nDecember all 3 curves have \"flattened out\", hence there is no point in\ndelaying planting -- the risks are not getting lower.\n\nThe messages would be clearer if the data in Fig. 7.8n are smoothed.\nThis can be done in the same way as for the rainfall totals, shown\nearlier in Fig. 7.8h.\n\nMany crops are sensitive to a long dry spell round flowering. The\ncalculation is slightly different to the one above, which assumed rain\nfor planting on day zero. This time we need the unconditional risks,\ni.e. a dry spell might have started before the flowering period and have\ncontinued.\n\nUse the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Transform*** dialogue again, with the\n***Spell*** tab, as shown in Fig. 7.8o. Then, with the same dialogue,\nuse the ***Moving*** tab, Fig. 7.8p, to get the maximum over 20 days.\nThis assumes that the flowering period is of 20 day's duration.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8o Ordinary spell lengths***                                        ***Fig. 7.8p Maximum over 20 days***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8o.png){width=\"3.0257491251093613in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8p.png){width=\"2.630612423447069in\"\n  height=\"2.940517279090114in\"}                          height=\"2.998286307961505in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next steps are just as before, i.e. in Fig. 7.8k to Fig. 7.8n. They\nuse the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\> Climatic Summaries*** dialogue to get\nthe percentage of years each day, with a longer dry spell than 7 or 9\ndays. The resulting percentages are then plotted, as before, using the\n***Describe \\> Specific \\> Line Plot*** dialogue.\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8q Adding a loess smoother***               ***Fig. 7.8r***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8q.png){width=\"2.816068460192476in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8r.png){width=\"2.97377624671916in\"\n  height=\"3.2467618110236223in\"}                        height=\"3.6244203849518812in\"}\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis time, for illustration, the smoothing has been done \"on the fly\",\nas additional layers in the plot. Local smoothing has been used with\nloess, as explained in more detail in Chapter 8.\n\nThe percentages are (as would be expected[^42]) slightly higher in Fig.\n7.8r, compared with Fig. 7.8n. They show a minimum risk if the start of\nthe flowering period is towards the end of January.\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8s***               ***Fig. 7.8t Plot the cumulative data***\n  ----------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8s.png){width=\"2.312619203849519in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8t.png){width=\"3.2892607174103237in\"\n  height=\"3.1737740594925636in\"}                        height=\"2.838529090113736in\"}\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe final example examines the cumulative rainfall distribution each\nyear, or season. This starts, again, with the ***Climatic \\> Prepare \\>\nTransform*** dialogue, this time using the ***Cumulative*** button, Fig.\n7.8s.\n\nThis adds a column, called cumsum, Fig. 7.8s, giving the accumulated\nrainfall each year.\n\nNow use the ***Describe \\> Specific \\> Line Plot*** dialogue to graph\nthe cumulative data against the day of the year, Fig. 7.8t.\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8u Facet sub-dialogue -- by year***          ***Fig. 7.8v Filter to choose the first 20 complete\n                                                         years***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8u.png){width=\"2.5613046806649167in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8v.png){width=\"3.4806069553805776in\"\n  height=\"2.625959098862642in\"}                          height=\"2.5952230971128607in\"}\n\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Fig 7.8t, use ***Plot Options*** to put the different years each in\ntheir own graph (facet), Fig. 7.8u. Then use the ***Data Options***\nbutton, which is on each dialogue, and is another way to get to the\nfiltering system. Choose the first 20 years of data, Fig. 7.8u as 89\nyears are too many graphs to show together.\n\nThe resulting graph is in Fig. 7.8w. Each graph starts at zero and rises\nto the annual (seasonal) total. So, for example 1938-39 was a year with\nover 1000mm, while 1933-34 had only about half that total.\n\nVertical lines, in Fig. 7.8w, correspond to high rainfall and horizontal\nlines to dry spells. The 1932-33 season looked like a \"bumpy year\".\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8w Cumulative rainfall for 20 years at Moorings***\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8w.png){width=\"6.006608705161855in\"\n  height=\"2.944076990376203in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you remove the facets from the graphs specified in Fig. 7.8t and\ninstead put the year factor in the main dialogue in ***Factor\n(Optional)***, then the resulting graph is in Fig. 7.8x. This type of\ndisplay can be useful for monitoring, as you can super-impose the\ncurrent year. An example is shown below.\n\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8x Single graph of cumulative rainfall      ***Fig. 7.8y***\n  (mm).***                                              \n  ----------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8x.png){width=\"2.931535433070866in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8y.png){width=\"2.9926859142607176in\"\n  height=\"2.9797069116360455in\"}                        height=\"3.023222878390201in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThese graphs can be taken further. As an example, in Fig. 7.8y the green\nlines indicate the start of the rains each year, while the red lines\nshow the date of the end of the season. The early and late starts, and\nends, are therefore indicated. A long season is one where the lines are\nfar apart, and so on. We explain, in Chapter 8, how these features can\nbe added.\n\nBoxplots can alternatively be used to display the cumulative data. A\nchallenge is to plot them at the end of each 10-day period. This is the\nfirst example of the use of the ***dekads*** in this guide, so return to\nthe ***Climatic \\> Dates \\> Use Date*** dialogue and complete it as\nshown in Fig. 7.8z. The year is shifted, so the dekads start in August.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8z***                                        ***Fig. 7.8aa***\n  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8z.png){width=\"2.3831791338582677in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8aa.png){width=\"3.590676946631671in\"\n  height=\"2.13535542432196in\"}                           height=\"2.3581496062992127in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst get a logical column, which is TRUE on the last day of each dekad,\nand FALSE otherwise[^43]. This uses the calculator, ***Prepare \\>\nColumn: Calculate \\> Calculations.*** Complete it as shown in Fig.\n7.8aa.\n\nNow ***filter*** so just the rows when the ***dek_diff*** variable is\nTRUE are used. The data are shown in Fig. 7.8 ab.\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8ab Filtered for the last day of each       ***Fig. 7.8ac***\n  dekad***                                              \n  ----------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8ab.png){width=\"3.213293963254593in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8ac.png){width=\"2.8236472003499564in\"\n  height=\"2.695550087489064in\"}                         height=\"2.6775962379702536in\"}\n\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow use ***Describe \\> Specific \\> Boxplot***, Fig. 7.8ac. The results\nare in Fig. 7.8ad[^44].\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8ad Boxplots showing the cumulative rainfall ***Fig. 7.8ae A new year***\n  at Moorings***                                         \n  ------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8ad.png){width=\"4.3325426509186356in\"   ![](figures/Fig7.8ae.png){width=\"1.69586176727909in\"\n  height=\"2.375553368328959in\"}                          height=\"2.4454811898512685in\"}\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFig. 7.8ad shows the progression of the cumulative rainfall for the\nseason towards the final totals. These had a median of 800mm, with a\nminimum less than 500mm and a maximum of well over 1000mm.\n\nOne use of this type of plot is to monitor a new year. As an example,\nFig. 7.8ae provides data, where the total has now risen to 340mm by the\nend of February. This information can now be super-imposed on the\nboxplots, as shown in Fig. 7.8af with the blue points[^45]. This example\nshows a great cause for concern. The totals are very low, compared to\nthe earlier 88 years of data.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ***Fig. 7.8af Adding the current year to the boxplots***\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ![](figures/Fig7.8af.png){width=\"4.862142388451444in\"\n  height=\"2.726807742782152in\"}\n\n
