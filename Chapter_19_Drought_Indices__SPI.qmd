# Drought Indices -- SPI
## Introduction

The Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) is acknowledged as an obvious
index to monitor drought, e.g. (Keyantash & (Eds), 2018). It is
described in the WMO guide (Svoboda, Hayes, & Wood, 2012).

There are various R packages to implement SPI and R-Instat includes the
command from the SPEI package (Beguería & Vicente-Serrano, 2017). This
permits the calculation of the SPI index, as described by WMO and an
SPEI index that includes evapotranspiration, (Vicente-Serrano, Beguería,
& López-Moreno, 2010).

The SPI index is promoted as being superior to the Palmer Drought
Severity Index. This is based on an original index by (Palmer, 1965),
generalised by (Wells, Goddard, & Hayes, 2004) and implemented in their
R package, called scPDSI (Zhong, Chen, Wang, & Chengguang, 2018) to
produce both the self-calibrating and the conventional Palmer index.

## Using the SPI index 

For illustration use the Nigerian data from Samaru, ***File \> Open from
Library \> Instat \> Browse \> Climatic \> Nigeria***, Fig. 12.2a. The
data frame, called samaru56t, has already been defined as climatic and
has 56 years of daily rainfall data.

  ***Fig. 18.2a***                                      ***Fig. 18.2b***

The SPI index is usually used on monthly data, though this is not
essential. Hence use ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Climatic Summaries***, as
shown in Fig. 18.2b. On the ***Summaries sub-dialogue*** choose the
***Count not missing*** and the ***Sum***. The monthly totals are shown
in Fig. 18.2a.

  ***Fig. 18.2c***                                      ***Fig. 18.2d***

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now use Climatic \> Prepare \> SPI, Fig. 18.2d. Complete the dialogue as
shown in Fig. 18.2d, giving the resulting column the name spi1, because
the index is for single months.

Then return to the SPI dialogue. Change the time scale to 3 (months) and
the name of the resulting column to spi3.

Repeat again, changing the time scale to 12, i.e. to a full year and
change the name to spi12.

The first years of the resulting data are shown in Fig. 18.2e. The
results are interpreted and the graphed.

To help with the interpretation Fig. 18.2f shows boxplots of the monthly
data.

First examine March 1928, that has an spi1 index of +2. This has
resulted from the rainfall total of 52.6mm. Fig. 18.2f shows that this
is very large for March -- it is the 2^nd^ highest from the 56 years.
Hence positive values of 2 (or more) indicate very rainy compared to the
norm. March 1929 had 12.7mm, and the spi1 index of 1.06 indicates that
even this value is quite large. Often the March total is zero.

August 1928 had a modestly negative value of spi1 = -0.456. This was
from the August total of 233mm, and the boxplot indicated that this is
slightly lower than average. In contrast, August 1929 had 356mm, which
is higher than the average, and corresponds to the spi1 index of +1.

The spi3 index fist calculates the 3-month running sums. Hence it
indicates how they compare with what is expected. For example, from Fig.
18.2e, April to June 1928 is all each individually higher than expected.
Hence the April to June 1928 total is surprisingly high and has an spi3
index of +1.83.

The 12-month index gives information about the annual (running) totals.
To investigate these, use the Climatic \> Prepare \> Climatic Summaries
again. Change the top button in Fig. 18.2b to Annual to give a data
frame with 56 values. Now use either ***Prepare \> Column: Calculations
\> Calculate*** or ***Prepare Column: Calculate \> Column Summaries***
on the ***sum_rain*** variable to show the annual mean is 1068mm and the
standard deviation is 178.5mm.

The total in 1928 was 1262mm. This is higher than the mean of 1068mm and
hence a positive spi12 value is expected for December 1928 in Fig.
18.2e. If we standardise the annual total, i.e. evaluate:

(1262 -- mean)/sd = (1262 -- 1068) /178.5 = +1.086, which is close to
the spi12value of 1.074.

In 1929, the total was 1284mm and the standardised value was (1284 --
1068)/178.5 = 1.21, again close to the spi12 index for December 1929 in
Fig. 18.2e, of 1.18.

The calculations to produce the spi index is relatively complex. A
distribution is fitted to the data and then the equivalents from the
normal distribution are found. For the annual totals, the distribution
is already close to normal, as is shown by the density plot in Fig.
18.2g. Then the normal distribution is used, as in Fig. 18.2h, where the
value for 1928 is indicated. The results are then standardised, which
just changes the x-axis in Fig. 18.2h to go from roughly -2 to + 2. In
fig 18.2h -2 corresponds to a value of 1068 -- 2 \* 178.5 = 711mm. A
value of 711mm has a probability of 1 year in 40 (probability of about
0.025) of occurring and represents a severe drought. (Most readers will
remember the value of ± 1.96, i.e. about ± 2 that gives the 5% points
from the standard normal distribution.)

The indices from Fig. 18.2e can be plotted in a variety of ways. The
"standard" time series graphs look cluttered, as they include the
seasonality within the graph. Fig. 18.2i presents graphs of spi1 and
spi12 separately for each of the months. It shows that spi1 is
meaningless in the dry months (November to February). Lines at 0 and -2
have been added and show largely that any problem is towards the later
years.

## The SPEI index

[Need to add this section. It works "trivially" by giving a
water-ba;ance variable instead of the rainfall. So, it could be within
R-Instat that we just use the Climatic \> Prepare \> Transform dialogue
first, to get the water balance, and then return to the SPI
dialogue.]{.mark}

## Palmer Drought Severity Index

[Check first whether we add it to the dialogue, add another dialogue, or
try to give it as a command.]{.mark}
