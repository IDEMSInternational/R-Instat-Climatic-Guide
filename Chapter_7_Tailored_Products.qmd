# Tailored Products
## Introduction

Products by NMSs include regular reports, such as climate normal and
10-day bulletins through the rainy season. It is useful if they also
produce "tailored products" that correspond to the specific demands of
users.

In many countries, one such product is the "start of the rains". This is
usually not a single fixed definition but may depend on factors such as
the crop being planted and the type of soil. The results in this chapter
are mainly based on an analysis of the daily rainfall data.

In early years on this type of work, e.g. (Stern, Dennett, & Dale, 1982)
some researchers questioned the need for the daily (rainfall) data. This
was often because sufficient results could be obtained through an
analysis of monthly totals supplemented, when needed, with 10-day
(dekads) or weekly totals.

This was partly due to a mis-understanding that the analysis would use
the daily values directly. Instead, the daily values are simply used in
an initial step to calculate appropriate summaries and these are on a
yearly basis. The results are then presented in the same ways as the
rainfall totals and total number of rain days in Chapter 6.

## Getting ready

One of the examples used in this Chapter is from Moorings in Southern
Zambia. This has rainfall data from early 1922. Use ***Open From Library
\> Instat \> Browse \> Climatic \> Zambia*** and open the file called
***Moorings.rds***.

A feature of Moorings, like many stations in Southern Africa, is that
the rainy season is from November to April. (This is roughly the mirror
image of the Sahel, where the rains are from May to October.) Hence the
year is "shifted" and we choose to start from August, Fig. 7.2a.

Use the ***Climatic \> Dates \> Use Date*** dialogue, Fig. 7.2a, and
complete as shown in Fig. 7.2b. Set the starting month to August.

The resulting data, after reordering the columns, is shown in Fig. 7.2b.

In Fig. 7.2b 1^st^ March 1922 is given as the season starting in 1921.
The year variable has also been given as a factor, to emphasise it is
the 1921-1922 season. The variable s_doy (shifted day of year) is 214 on
1^st^ March. It is the day number in the season starting from 1^st^
August as day 1.

Finally, in Fig. 7.2b, there seems nothing different about the
***month*** variable. But ***right-click*** on the column and choose
***Levels/Labels***, Fig. 7.2c. This shows, Fig. 7.2d, that the months
are now labelled from August, so all tables and graphs will now appear
from August to July, rather than from January to December. ***Close***
the ***Levels/Labels*** dialogue.

This dialogue should fill automatically, as shown in Fig. 7.2e. Check
that the dates define ***unique rows,*** Fig. 7.2e, and press ***Ok***.

We now assume use of the ***Climatic \> Check Data*** dialogues,
described in Chapter 5, and go straight to the ***Climatic \> Prepare***
menu, Fig. 7.2f***.*** Start with the ***Climatic \> Prepare \>
Transform*** dialogue, Fig. 7.2g. Complete it as shown to produce a new
variable, called rainday, see Fig. 7.2h, that facilitates the analysis
of the number of rain days. A rain day is defined as one with more than
0.85mm. You can choose a different threshold if you wish.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the dialogue, in Fig. 7.2i, should have completed automatically.
If not, then either the data frame was not defined as climatic, or you
are on the wrong data frame.

In Fig. 7.2i, include the ***rain*** variable. Press the ***Summaries***
button and choose just the ***Number not Missing*** and the ***Sum***.
The result should be a new annual data frame with 3 columns.

In Fig. 7.2i, change the variable to ***rainday*** and this time, just
get the ***sum*** as the only summary.

The resulting annual data frame is shown in Fig. 7.2j. The results show,
for example, that the 1922/23 season had a total of 853mm from 75 rain
days. Further columns will now be added, that give the start of the
rains each year, etc.

## **Start of the rains**

Return to the daily data and use ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Start of the
Rains***, see Fig. 7.2f.

The dialogue is shown in Fig. 7.3a. If it is not automatically completed
as in Fig. 7.2i, then either you did not define the data as climatic
(Fig. 7.2e), or you are on the wrong data frame.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

This is the first "tailored" product, i.e. there is no fixed definition.
What is needed is a definition that corresponds as closely as possible
to something used by farmers -- perhaps for a specified crop.

The first decision is the earliest possible planting date. If there were
rain in Moorings on 1^st^ October it would almost certainly be ignored,
because it would probably be followed by a long dry spell.

As an example, we suggest 15^th^ November as the earliest date. Then
also 15^th^ January as the latest date, i.e. after then it would not be
worth planting.

In Fig. 7.3a, press the Day Range button and complete the sub-dialogue
as shown in Fig. 7.3b.

After returning to Fig. 7.3a change the ***2 days to 3 days*** and
choose to also ***save the Date*** column. Then press ***Ok***. The full
definition is then:

***Event 1:*** "The first occasion from 15^th^ November with more than
20mm within a 3-day period."

The resulting data are in Fig. 7.3c. The Start of the rains dialogue has
added 2 more columns to the yearly data frame, one giving the day number
(from 1 August) and the other giving the date. In the 1922/23 season the
day was 119 or 27 November, while it was also in late November for the
following two seasons.

The start_doy column is used in the further analysis. The start_date
column is just to assist interpretation.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.3b***                                        ***Fig. 7.3c***

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the start date, or even with the totals from Section 7.2, you could
proceed straight to a PICSA-type graph.

Use ***Climatic \> PICSA \> Rainfall Graph***. Include the
***start_doy*** variable, and then the ***PICSA options*** Fig. 7.3d.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.3d***                                        ***Fig. 7.3e Sub-dialogue***

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sub-dialogue in Fig. 7.3e is used to display the ***Y-axis*** as
dates, rather than day numbers. Use also the ***Lines*** tab to add a
line for the mean, and possibly also the ***X-Axis*** to untick the
angle for the labels. The resulting graph is in Fig. 7.3f.

The graph shows the mean starting day was 28^th^ November. There was
just one year with a starting date in January. There were also 10 years
where the starting date was on the lower limit of 15^th^ November.
Perhaps the earliest date should have been even earlier?

As a small investigation, change the names of the two columns
(***right-click, Rename***). Then use the ***Climatic \> Prepare \>
Start of the Rains*** dialogue again, changing the earliest start date
to 1^st^ November[^36]. The definition is now:

***Event 2:*** "The first occasion from 1^st^ November with more than
20mm within a 3-day period."

Then the PICSA rainfall graph is run again (unaltered) giving the graph
in Fig. 7.3g. The mean is now 9 days earlier.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are other components of the Start of the Rains dialogue that can
optionally be used. For example, in India a definition (for the Summer
monsoon) is of the form:

***Event 3:*** First occasion from 1 June with more than 25mm in 5 days,
or which at least 3 days are rainy.

This uses the Number of Rainy Days checkbox in Fig. 7.3a.

The third checkbox in Fig. 7.3a is called Dry Spell. Events 1 and 2 can
be considered as defining planting opportunities, while if a dry spell
condition is added, this might define a successful planting.

***Rename*** the last columns that were produced -- so they are not
overwritten.

Then return to the ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Start of the Rains***
dialogue and check the ***Dry Spells*** checkbox, Fig. 7.3h. The
definition is now:

***Event 4:*** First occasion from 1^st^ November with more than 20mm in
3 days, and no dry spell of more than 9-days in the next 3 weeks (21
days).

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.3h***                                        ***Fig. 7.3i***

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data resulting from Events 1, 2 and 4 are shown in Fig. 7.3i. They
show that in 1965, with Event 2, there was a planting opportunity on 13
November, but that was not successful. The date of the successful
planting was 20^th^ December.

There was just one year, namely 1972, where there was no successful
planting by the imposed limit of 15 January.

Event 2 and Event 4 can be compared. Use ***Prepare \> Column: Calculate
\> Calculations*** and subtract the date of Event 2 from Event 4, Fig.
7.3j.

+---------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| ***Fig. 7.3j Difference from    | ***Fig. 7.3k Exceedance graph for  |

+---------------------------------+------------------------------------+

The results are also shown in the last column in Fig. 7.3i. Where the
value in this last column is zero the first planting was successful.
Otherwise the value shows the delay, before the date of the successful
start. Looking down this column, or ***filtering***, or using ***Prepare
\> Column: Reshape \> Column Summaries*** shows there were 22 non-zero
values, a risk of 1 year in 4.

If this risk is too high, then one way to reduce it, might be to omit
the early planting dates and start later. Changing Event4 to start on
15^th^ November, and comparing those results with Event 1, changes the
risk to 12 years or about 14%.

Conservation farming is encouraged in Southern Zambia and one component
is water conservation, using planting in small hollows. The promoters
estimate this gives an extra 3 days, that seedlings could withstand
drought. So, keeping to 1 November in Event 4, and changing the 9 days
to 12 days could also be considered. This halves the risk, as there are
then just 10 years when replanting was needed.

The data may also be plotted as exceedance graphs, as is shown in Fig.
7.3k for the Events 1, 2 and 4.

## The end and length

A common definition for the end of the rainy season is based on a simple
water balance model. This has been adequate in the unimodal stations in
West Africa, but has problems with stations, like Moorings in the
Southern hemisphere.

Hence, we first look quickly at a site in Northern Nigeria, before
returning to discuss the end and length of the season at Moorings.

Use ***File \> Open from Library \> Instat \> Browse \> Climatic \>
Nigeria*** and open the file called ***Samaru.rds***. The data frame
called Samaru56t has 56 years of daily data from 1928, Fig. 7.4a.

This data frame is already defined as climatic, so proceed directly to
the ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Start of the Rains*** dialogue.

These data are from January. In this dialogue, set the earliest date as
***1st April*** and the latest as ***30 June***. Use ***Event 5*** as
shown in Fig. 7.4b:

***Event 5***: First occasion from ***1st April*** with more than
***20mm in 3 days*** and no dry spell longer than ***9 days*** in the
next ***21 days***.

As in the previous section, get the starting day of year and the
corresponding date.

Now use ***Climatic \> Prepare \> End of the Rains*** and complete the
dialogue as shown in Fig. 7.4c

The water balance "model" is like a simple "bucket". It is empty in the
dry season. It is then filled by the rainfall and loses a constant
amount of 5mm per day, due to evaporation. The capacity of the bucket,
in Fig. 7.4c, is 100mm. Any excess, when the bucket is full, is assumed
lost to runoff.

In the middle of the season (August), the bucket is usually quite full.
The end of the season is defined, in Fig. 7.4c, as the first time, after
15^th^ August, that the bucket is effectively empty.

The length of the season is then, from ***Climatic \> Prepare \>
Length,*** simply the difference between the end and the start dates,
Fig. 7.4d.

The resulting annual data are shown in Fig. 7.4e. Various graphs are
possible. The time series graph in Fig. 7.4f indicates clearly the
smaller inter-annual variability of the end of the season, compared to
the start. This graph was produced using ***Describe \> Specific \> Line
Plot***. An alternative would have been the ***Climatic \> PICSA \>
Rainfall Graph***.

An alternative display is with exceedance graphs, Fig. 7.4g. Here the
greater steepness of the line for the end of the season, corresponds to
the lower variability. The ***Prepare \> Column: Calculate \>
Calculations*** can be used to show the standard deviation of the start
is about 17 days (over 2 weeks), while it is about 9 days (just over 1
week) for the end of the season.

Fig. 7.4h shows the length of the season, using the ***Climatic \> PICSA
\> Rainfall Graphs*** dialogue. Terciles have been added to show that
about 1/3 of the years had a season length of less than 152 days, i.e. 5
months, and 1/3 had more than 172 days -- almost 6 months.

Now return to the Moorings data in the Southern hemisphere[^37]. The
start was considered in Section 7.3 and we choose the definition 4, i.e.
from 1 November, but with no dry spell of more than 12 days. In
principle it simply remains to get the end of the season, and then the
length, as above.

To illustrate the problem first try the same analysis as for Samaru,
Fig. 7.4i. Make the day range 15^th^ February to 15^th^ June, as the
equivalent of 15^th^ August to 15^th^ December for Samaru. The results
are in Fig. 7.4j and a few of the problems are highlighted.

In some years the season appears to end in February, and sometimes on
the precise day (15^th^ February) that is the lower limit. This never
happened at Samaru as the water balance was always full (or close to
full) throughout August. So, August, in the Sahel, has reliable rain.
This isn't the case at Moorings, where there can be a long dry spell at
any time in the season.

We would still prefer to consider issues in February as a problem during
the season -- which is covered in Section 7.6, - rather than necessarily
a very early end of the season.

In an analysis of 5 stations in Zimbabwe, (Mupamgwa, Walker, & Twomlow,
2011) proposed a different type of definition for the end of the season.
This was the ***last day with more than 10mm*** between 1 January and 30
June. This type of definition has been added to the ***Climatic \>
Prepare \> End of the Rains*** dialogue, Fig. 7.4k.

For Moorings we have used the last day with more than 10mm up to the end
of April, Fig. 4.7k.

In using this definition some meteorology staff complained that this was
clearly the end of the rains and they would prefer the end of the
season.

What is therefore also available in R-Instat is to use the above
definition for the end of the rains and then to start the water-balance
definition from that date -- which is a different date each year. Return
to ***Climatic \> Prepare \> End of Rains***, select the ***End of
Season*** and then the ***Day Range*** again, Fig. 7.4l.

In Fig. 7.4l choose ***Variable Day*** and select the ***end_rains***
variable from the summary data. Keep the end date as ***Fixed Day***,
and choose 30 June.

Return to the main dialogue, Fig. 7.4m and set as shown. The results are
shown in Fig. 7.4n and are more reasonable.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now use ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Length of Season***, as shown for
Samaru in Fig. 7.4d, to give the length.

The start and end of the season are plotted in Fig. 7.4o. Unlike Samaru,
they are approximately equally variable, and each has a standard
deviation of just over 2 weeks. The cumulative frequency graph
illustrates the same point, with each of the start, end_rains and
end_season having roughly equal slopes and with each having a range of
about 2 months (i.e. roughly 4 times the standard deviation).

## Coping with censored and missing data

Censoring occurs in many areas of application of statistics. The topic
is particularly important in the analysis of medical data. There the
survival times of patients may be recorded for a study up to 3 years.
Those who survive longer are the censored observations. We know the
survival is more than 3 years, but don't know exactly how long.

In hydrology the height of a river may be measured. At times of flooding
the height may be more than the measuring instrument, but the exact
value isn't known.

In climatology a heavy wind may destroy the measuring equipment. In that
case the exact censoring point is unknown, but we do know that a large
value occurred.

There is also possible censoring with the start and end of the season in
Sections 7.3 and 7.4.

To illustrate, use the ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Start of the Rains***
dialogue again, Fig. 7.5a. This time we deliberately choose a small
planting window, Fig. 7.5b. The latest planting date is designed to be
the date beyond which a farmer would not think it would be sensible to
plant for that season. That is not likely to be 30 November, but we
choose that early date to illustrate the issue of censoring.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.5a***                                        ***Fig. 7.5b***

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Fig. 7.5a the variable names for the results are also changed, to
avoid overwriting the previous variables. The results are in Fig. 7.5c,
together with the previous ones. In the 1925/26 season the earliest
planting opportunity was 3^rd^ January. This is now too late and hence
is now given as a missing value. The same is done in the following
season when the earliest date was 8^th^ December.

In the subsequent analysis we should examine the number of occasions
that planting was not possible. One way is to use the ***Climatic \>
Tidy and Examine \> One Variable Summarise*** dialogue, Fig. 7.5d.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.5c***                                        ***Fig. 7.5d***

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The results, in Fig. 7.5e, indicates there were 17 seasons in which the
new starting date was censored. However, the problem is that there was
already one season for which the original definition was missing. That
was not due to censoring, but because there were also missing values in
the first season.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.5e***                                      ***Fig. 7.5f***

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, there were, 16 years when no planting was possible in November. That
is interesting information itself. But the main problem is that the
summaries are missing for 2 different reasons, namely either because
there were days with missing data, or because planting was not possible,
i.e. there was censoring.

To proceed we fist explain how R-Instat handles missing values, i.e.
days when the rainfall was not recorded. There are various options when
producing (say) monthly summaries that were discussed earlier. But what
happens with the start and end of the rains.

For the start of the rains the summary is set to missing if any day is
missing in the period calculated. For example in Fig. 7.5c the start in
1922/23 was on 27^th^ November.

-   Had any value been missing between 1^st^ and 27^th^ November 1922,
    then the result would have been set to missing.

-   If there were a missing day on 1^st^ December 1922 the result would
    be given, i.e. it would not be set to missing, because the rains had
    already started.

-   One detail is that the result would also be set to missing if either
    30^th^ or 31^st^ October 1922 were missing, because then the 3-day
    total on 1^st^ November cannot be calculated.

The same idea is true for the end of the rains, i.e. if a missing value
is encountered in the period when it calculates the end of the rains,
then the result is set to missing. Otherwise it is given.

For the Moorings data there is only one missing day in the record, once
it has started in early 1922. This was on 10^th^ March 2004. The end of
the rains was defined to be last occasion with more than 10mm between 1
January and 30 June. This missing value is within the period, but the
calculation has "worked backwards" and found the last day on 23^rd^
March 2004. The missing value did not affect this calculation and hence
the value is given.

The calculation is more complicated for the water balance definition. If
there are missing water-balance values in the period of calculation,
then the summary is set to missing. If the rainfall is ever missing,
then the water balance is set to missing. Once the rainfall is no longer
missing the water balance may still be missing, because it does not know
what the state was, just after the rainfall data resumed. Hence, the
analysis is doubled, starting with both a full and an empty balance
(i.e. the two extremes). While these are different, the water balance is
still set to missing. Once they are the same, the water balance
calculation resumes.

These decisions on missing values are strict and some users may feel
that a single missing day should not set the summary for that year, or
season, to be missing. In that case consider infilling the data,
discussed in chapter [xxx]{.mark}.

We now return to the censoring problem. Return to the ***Climatic \>
Prepare \> Start of the Rains*** dialogue in Fig. 7.5a and tick the
third option for saving columns, called ***Occurrence***. This adds a
logical column to the summaries that can be used to distinguish between
missing and censored seasons.

## During the season

This section considers examples of risks during the rainy season.

Chapter 6 examined rainfall totals and rain days throughout the year.
Now they are examined for the season.

The simplest is to consider fixed periods. At Moorings the rainy season
is from November to April. Use ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Climatic
Summaries***, as shown in Fig. 7.6a.

In Fig. 7.6a press ***Summaries*** and choose just the ***N
non-missing*** and the ***Sum***. Click on ***Day Range*** and choose
***1 November to 30 April***.

+---------------------------------+------------------------------------+

Once run, change the ***rain*** variable in Fig. 7.6a, to
***raindays,*** and this time just get the ***Sum***. You may have found
that the variables overwrote the ones produced earlier for the full
year. To ensure this does not happen in the future, rename the 3
columns, Fig. 7.6b. It is also useful to add an explanatory label as
shown in Fig. 7.6b.

+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The totals can also be calculated for the rainy season each year. Return
to the ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Climatic Summaries*** dialogue. Use the
***rain*** variable and then press ***Day Range***. Complete as shown in
Fig. 7.6c, where the total is now from the ***start doy*** to the
***end-season***. This is confirmed on the ***return*** to the main
dialogue, Fig. 7.6d.

In Fig. 7.6d click on Summaries and choose the Count Non Missing and the
Sum. Once produced, ***right-click*** and ***rename*** the Sum variable
as ***rainSeason***. The ***Count Non Missing*** column is now the
season length. This is another way to get the length!

A third possibility is to produce the total (or the number of rain days)
for a fixed period following the start. Return once more to the
***Climatic \> Prepare \> Climatic Summaries*** and change the ***Day
Range*** as indicated in Fig. 7.6e, i.e. for ***120 days from the
start***.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.6e***                                        ***Fig. 7.6f***

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This would be for a 120-day crop. The approximate water requirement of
many crops is known, so the results are the first step in calculating
the risks of not having enough water for a specified (20 day) crop in
the period following planting.

The summary columns produced are shown in Fig. 7.6f.

The results are presented as exceedance probabilities in Fig. 7.6g and
as time series in Fig. 7.6h.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The three totals are sufficiently similar that plotting the 3 lines on a
single time-series graph in Fig. 7.6h would be confusing, so they are
plotted as facets[^38]....

The same ideas are now considered for spell lengths. In the tropics,
drought is a problem and hence we consider the occurrence of long dry
spells. The same dialogue could equally be used for hot, or cold, spells
in temperature data, etc.

The simplest is to find the longest spell length within the main months
of the rainy season. Continuing with the Moorings data, use ***Climatic
\> Prepare \> Spells***, Fig. 7.6i.

Use the Day Range sub-dialogue to specify ***January 1 to March 31*** as
the range of days. The results, shown in Fig. 7.6j give the longest
dry-spell length within this 3-month period. It shows the longest number
of consecutive days with rain less than 0.85mm on any day.

To clarify the results, use ***Climatic \> Check Data \> Display
Daily***[^39]. Data for 4 early years are in Fig. 7.6k to be compared
with the results in Fig. 7.6j.

In Fig. 7.6j the longest spell in 1924 is 19 days. Fig. 7.6k shows that
this is a spell from 13^th^ February to 2^nd^ March. In 1925 the longest
spell was just 6 days and was at the end of March. This included days
with small rainfalls, but each was lower than the 0.85mm threshold.

The 7-day spell in 1926 was also at the end of March. In 1927 there was
also a long dry spell (14 days) at the end of March, and this also shows
that just the longest spell is given. That year also had 13 consecutive
dry days in January. If more detail is needed, then the three months
could be considered individually.

It sometimes causes confusion that the longest spell in a month can be
longer than the month itself. We illustrate by calculating the longest
spell length in April. The results are also given in the last column in
Fig. 7.6j. They show that the longest dry spell in April 2024 was 43
days. This is confirmed from Fig. 7.6k, because 1^st^ April 2024
"inherited" a dry spell from March, of 13 days, i.e. from 19^th^ March.
So, 1^st^ April was already the 14^th^ consecutive dry day and this had
become 43 days by the ned of April. There is an option in the dialogue
if you only wish to consider April itself. This option is used in
Section 7.7.

As with the rainfall totals, it is sometimes useful to find the longest
dry spell in the rainy season, (i.e. between the day of the start and
the end) or in part of the season. As with the rainfall totals this uses
the start and end dates each year. In the ***Climatic \> Prepare \>
Spells*** dialogue, change the day range as was shown for the rainfall
totals in Fig. 7.6c and Fig. 7.6e.

Fig. 7.6l shows the results for the season, i.e. between the date of the
start of the rains and the end of the season. The median value for the
longest spell length is 14 days (2 weeks). The terciles are also given,
showing that one year in 3 has a longest spell length of 12 days or
less. But also a third of the years has a spell length of 18 days or
more.

Fig. 7.6m shows the longest spell lengths for the 120 days following
planting. The results are similar, but without the longest spells shown
in Fig. 7.6l.

Many crops are particularly sensitive to dry spells during the flowering
period. This is typically about 20 days (3 weeks). Suppose a crop that
reaches the start of flowering 50 days after planting. Calculating the
risk is currently a 2-stage process in R-Instat. First produce the new
column, for the start of flowering, Fig. 7.6n. This is an instance where
you can also transform the start_date as is shown in Fig. 7.6o.

The resulting data are in Fig. 7.6p. The ***flower_date*** variable
shows that the flowering period often starts late in December or in
early January, but it is occasionally also in February.

The ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Spells*** dialogue is now used from the
***start_flower*** day for ***20 days***. The resulting variable is also
shown in Fig. 7.6p and is seen often to be quite short. For example, the
longest spell from early 2024 for the next few years is usually just 2
or 3 consecutive dry days.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The results are plotted in Fig. 7.6q using ***Climatic \> PICSA \>
Rainfall Graph*** again. Only in 1/3 of the years is there a dry spell
of one week or more. However, in 13 of the 77 years, i.e. one year in
six, there was a dry spell of 10 days or more.

The graph in Fig. 7.6q is from a variable date. In a particular year,
once you know the planting date, or also from crops that are photoperiod
sensitive, the dates are fixed. Once calculated, if the risk is high,
then perhaps remedial action can be taken, such as planning for some
irrigated water to be available for this period.

A third aspect that can cause a problem during the season is a climatic
extreme. This may be drought, as considered in the dry spells above. It
could also be an extreme wind, or excessive rainfall causing flooding.
Extremes are considered in detail in Chapter 11, hence only a single
example is given here.

A question posed in relation to rainfall in Niger, was the risk of more
than 100m rain within a 3-day period. The argument was that while a
single day with more than 100mm would be a problem, so would, say 40mm,
on each of 3 days.

Three day running totals were already used "behind the scenes" in
calculating the start of the rains. Now these totals are needed
explicitly. Use ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Transform***, as shown in Fig.
7.6r.

The resulting daily data, in Fig. 7.6s, show an instance in February
1923 where the total is more than 100mm.

Now the ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Climatic Summaries*** dialogue may be
used again, as shown in Fig. 7.6t. The summaries are from ***January to
March*** and the only summary is the ***Maximum***, Fig. 7.6u.

## It rained yesterday. Should I plant?

For Moorings, in Zambia, the definition for the start of the rains was
the first occasion from 1 November with more than 20mm in 3 days.

For successful planting the condition was added that there should not be
a dry spell of more than 9 (consecutive) dry days in the next 21 days.
In Section 7.3 the two columns (with and without the dry-spell
condition) were compared, showing that replanting would be needed in 1
year in 4.

That is an overall risk, because sometimes a planting opportunity was
early and in other years there was no opportunity until December. If the
data are examined more closely, they show that planting was possible by
6^th^ November in 14 of the years. However, replanting was needed (i.e.
the dry spell condition wasn't satisfied) in 7 of these years. That is a
risk of 1 year in 2 when very early planting was possible. Perhaps 1^st^
November is too early to consider planting, unless you are willing to
entertain the high risk.

This question can be turned around. Suppose, in a particular year, there
is a potential planting date on 7^th^ November. What is the risk from
planting then?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.7aDry spell risk after planting***          ***Fig. 7.7b Result from 8 Nov and 8 Dec***
  ----------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image454.png){width="2.881582458442695in"   ![](media/image434.png){width="2.830893482064742in"
  height="3.3937401574803148in"}                        height="3.4122856517935256in"}

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Fig. 7.7a the ***Day Range*** is from 8 November for 21 days. Another
change is that 7^th^ November is assumed to be rainy, i.e. not in a dry
spell. So, the ***checkbox "Assume condition not satisfied at the
start"*** is ticked.

The results, in Fig. 7.7b indicate that planting early is quite risky.
Four years have a dry spell of 10 days or more, even in the few years
shown in Fig. 7.7b. If you change the dates in Fig. 7.7a by a month,
then the same analysis shows just a single year now gives a problem.
Interestingly that year was not a problem with the early planting.

Summarising the two columns[^40] shows 32 years, about 1 year in 3, had
a dry spell of more than 9 days with the early planting, compared with
just 11 years, or 1 year in 8, from the later planting date

What we lose on risk from early planting, we potentially gain by having
a longer season length. In Section 7.4 the season length was

***Length = end_season -- start_doy.***

The results were shown in Fig. 7.4q and showed that about 1/3 of the
years had a season length of less than 4 months, etc. This figure is
repeated as Fig. 7.7c

Now that we know the start is on day 100 (8^th^ November) and hence the
length is, instead, found from:

***Length =*** ***end_season -- 100***

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.7c***                                        ***Fig. 7.7d***
  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image442.png){width="3.1445713035870515in"   ![](media/image455.png){width="2.862133639545057in"
  height="2.201829615048119in"}                          height="2.2399857830271217in"}

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparing the information in Fig. 7.7c and 7.7d shows that with early
planting, on day 100, there are virtually no years with a season length
of less than 4 months. This is compared to 1/3 of the years overall
(Fig. 7.7c). The variability is also considerably reduced, because the
start is now fixed. The variability is now only because of the
uncertainty of the end.

With this early planting we could therefore perhaps plan for 120-day
crop. That would have almost no risk in terms of season length. If the
proposed crop needs (say) 600mm of water, we could now find the
proportion of years with at least that total. That uses the ***Climatic
\> Prepare \> Climatic Summaries*** dialogue, as shown in Fig. 7.7e.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.7e***                                        
  ------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image437.png){width="2.2509109798775153in"   ![](media/image435.png){width="3.585155293088364in"
  height="2.7010925196850395in"}                         height="2.7200470253718287in"}

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The resulting totals can then be examined in various ways. The
time-series graph, Fig. 7.7f, is one option. This indicates quite a high
risk of less than 600mm. A crop needing only 500mm would have a much
lower risk. There are only a few years with much less than 500mm.

An alternative, with this early planting, could be to aim for a
short-duration cereal crop, e.g. 90 days and then to try for a
short-season legume, that might be planted as the cereal is close to
maturity. Fig. 7.7d indicates that this would often have had enough time
for fodder, and occasionally would have long enough to mature.

## Reduce risks

In the previous section risks were calculated relative to a proposed
planting date. In this section we examine the seasonal pattern of the
risks. This enables a study of the following types of problem.

-   For Moorings the risk of replanting was about one year in three if
    planting on 8^th^ November. (Assuming replanting is needed if there
    is a dry spell of 10 days or longer in the following 21 days.) How
    does this risk depend on the date of planting? Does the risk ever
    approach zero?

-   For the option of a 120-day crop that needs (say) at least 600mm of
    water, when would be the best days to plant?

The method is similar for these two -- and for other similar problems.
For simplicity the 120-day total is considered first. There is no
special dialogue, so the analysis proceeds step-by-step.

First use the ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Transform*** dialogue as shown
in Fig. 7.8a. This transforms the rainfall data into 120-day moving
totals. The resulting data are shown in Fig. 7.8b after reordering the
columns. They show that in the 1922/23 season there was more than 600mm
if planting was before 11^th^ January.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.8a***                                        ***Fig. 7.8b***

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These data re now summarised over the years, this time to get a value
for each day of the year. This uses the ***Climatic \> Prepare \>
Climatic Summaries*** dialogue, Fig. 7.8c. Use the ***Within Year***
option in Fig. 7.8c and complete the dialogue as shown.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.8c***                                       ***Fig. 7.8d***

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Climatic Summaries sub-dialogue use the ***More*** tab as shown
in Fig. 7.8d.

This produces a new data frame shown in Fig. 7.8e.

Repeat the dialogue in Fig. 7.8c, changing the 600mm to 450mm

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.8e***                                        ***Fig. 7.8f***

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It now just remains to graph the results. This uses the ***Describe \>
Specific \> Line Plot*** dialogue, Fig. 7.8f. The results are in Fig.
7.8g[^41].

In Fig 7.8g the higher (red) line is for 600mm. It shows the minimum
risk corresponds to a planting on about 15^th^ November and is then
about 0.3 (30%). The lower line, for 450mm, is below 1 year in 10, for
plantings from 1 November to about 10 December.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One improvement in the presentation would be to smooth the lines given
in Fig. 7.8g. They are quite smooth already, as there were 88 years of
data. With shorter records the need for smoothing becomes greater.

Moving averages are the simplest way of smoothing. Use ***Climatic \>
Prepare \> Transform*** as shown in Fig. 7.8h. This adds the 2 smoothed
columns to the data frame.

Note also that the risks are (of course) very high from March onwards.
Hence filter the data on the day of year. The 1^st^ March is s_doy =
214.

Fig. 7.8i shows plots of the data together with the smoothed lines. R
and hence R-Instat has many other methods of smoothing data. One
alternative method is shown below in Fig. 7.8q.

The same ideas can be used to examine the risks of a long dry spell at
different points in the season. We first consider the risk of a dry
spell after a planting occasion, i.e. after a rain day. This uses the
special ***Multiple Spells*** tab in the ***Climatic \> Prepare \>
Transform*** dialogue. In Fig. 7.8j the maximum spell length is taken
over 21 days, and that can, of course, be changed as required.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.8k***                                       ***Fig. 7.8l***

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next step, as before, uses the ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Climatic
Summaries*** dialogue, Fig.7.8k to calculate the proportion of years
with a dry-spell ***longer than 9 days*** in the 21 days, following
planting, i.e. to correspond to the default values in the ***Start of
the Rains*** dialogue.

Once calculated, repeat the operation with 7 days (for a more sensitive
crop) and 12 days, perhaps to correspond to the extra days following a
conservation farming strategy.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.8m***                                        ***Fig. 7.8n***

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The data are shown in Fig. 7.8m where, for variety, we have used
percentages rather than proportions.

The dry-spell risks are shown in Fig. 7.8n. They show that, in early
November, it is quite advantageous, in terms of risk, to have the
12-days, rather than the 9 days assurance for the dry spells. By early
December all 3 curves have "flattened out", hence there is no point in
delaying planting -- the risks are not getting lower.

The messages would be clearer if the data in Fig. 7.8n are smoothed.
This can be done in the same way as for the rainfall totals, shown
earlier in Fig. 7.8h.

Many crops are sensitive to a long dry spell round flowering. The
calculation is slightly different to the one above, which assumed rain
for planting on day zero. This time we need the unconditional risks,
i.e. a dry spell might have started before the flowering period and have
continued.

Use the ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Transform*** dialogue again, with the
***Spell*** tab, as shown in Fig. 7.8o. Then, with the same dialogue,
use the ***Moving*** tab, Fig. 7.8p, to get the maximum over 20 days.
This assumes that the flowering period is of 20 day's duration.

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

The next steps are just as before, i.e. in Fig. 7.8k to Fig. 7.8n. They
use the ***Climatic \> Prepare \> Climatic Summaries*** dialogue to get
the percentage of years each day, with a longer dry spell than 7 or 9
days. The resulting percentages are then plotted, as before, using the
***Describe \> Specific \> Line Plot*** dialogue.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This time, for illustration, the smoothing has been done "on the fly",
as additional layers in the plot. Local smoothing has been used with
loess, as explained in more detail in Chapter 8.

The percentages are (as would be expected[^42]) slightly higher in Fig.
7.8r, compared with Fig. 7.8n. They show a minimum risk if the start of
the flowering period is towards the end of January.

The final example examines the cumulative rainfall distribution each
year, or season. This starts, again, with the ***Climatic \> Prepare \>
Transform*** dialogue, this time using the ***Cumulative*** button, Fig.
7.8s.

This adds a column, called cumsum, Fig. 7.8s, giving the accumulated
rainfall each year.

Now use the ***Describe \> Specific \> Line Plot*** dialogue to graph
the cumulative data against the day of the year, Fig. 7.8t.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.8u Facet sub-dialogue -- by year***          ***Fig. 7.8v Filter to choose the first 20 complete
                                                         years***
  ------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image261.png){width="2.5613046806649167in"   ![](media/image278.png){width="3.4806069553805776in"

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Fig 7.8t, use ***Plot Options*** to put the different years each in
their own graph (facet), Fig. 7.8u. Then use the ***Data Options***
button, which is on each dialogue, and is another way to get to the
filtering system. Choose the first 20 years of data, Fig. 7.8u as 89
years are too many graphs to show together.

The resulting graph is in Fig. 7.8w. Each graph starts at zero and rises
to the annual (seasonal) total. So, for example 1938-39 was a year with
over 1000mm, while 1933-34 had only about half that total.

Vertical lines, in Fig. 7.8w, correspond to high rainfall and horizontal
lines to dry spells. The 1932-33 season looked like a "bumpy year".

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you remove the facets from the graphs specified in Fig. 7.8t and
instead put the year factor in the main dialogue in ***Factor
(Optional)***, then the resulting graph is in Fig. 7.8x. This type of
display can be useful for monitoring, as you can super-impose the
current year. An example is shown below.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.8x Single graph of cumulative rainfall      ***Fig. 7.8y***
  (mm).***                                              
  ----------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image259.png){width="1.863001968503937in"   ![](media/image270.png){width="4.23174978127734in"
  height="2.067361111111111in"}                         height="2.080711942257218in"}

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These graphs can be taken further. As an example, in Fig. 7.8y the green
lines indicate the start of the rains each year, while the red lines
show the date of the end of the season. The early and late starts, and
ends, are therefore indicated. A long season is one where the lines are
far apart, and so on. We explain, in Chapter 8, how these features can
be added.

Boxplots can alternatively be used to display the cumulative data. A
challenge is to plot them at the end of each 10-day period. This is the
first example of the use of the ***dekads*** in this guide, so return to
the ***Climatic \> Dates \> Use Date*** dialogue and complete it as
shown in Fig. 7.8z. The year is shifted, so the dekads start in August.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.8z***                                        ***Fig. 7.8aa***

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First get a logical column, which is TRUE on the last day of each dekad,
and FALSE otherwise[^43]. This uses the calculator, ***Prepare \>
Column: Calculate \> Calculations.*** Complete it as shown in Fig.
7.8aa.

Now ***filter*** so just the rows when the ***dek_diff*** variable is
TRUE are used. The data are shown in Fig. 7.8 ab.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.8ab Filtered for the last day of each       ***Fig. 7.8ac***

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now use ***Describe \> Specific \> Boxplot***, Fig. 7.8ac. The results
are in Fig. 7.8ad[^44].

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***Fig. 7.8ad Boxplots showing the cumulative rainfall ***Fig. 7.8ae A new year***

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fig. 7.8ad shows the progression of the cumulative rainfall for the
season towards the final totals. These had a median of 800mm, with a
minimum less than 500mm and a maximum of well over 1000mm.

One use of this type of plot is to monitor a new year. As an example,
Fig. 7.8ae provides data, where the total has now risen to 340mm by the
end of February. This information can now be super-imposed on the
boxplots, as shown in Fig. 7.8ae with the blue points[^45]. This example
shows a great cause for concern. The totals are very low, compared to
the earlier 88 years of data.
